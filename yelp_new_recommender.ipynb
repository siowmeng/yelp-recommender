I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  \\n\\nTravis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! \\n\\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! \\n\\nTravis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This review is in regards to our experience watching SuperBowl 51 February 5, 2017 at the WestGate in the theater/auditorium.\\n\\nWatch the game somewhere else.....\\n\\nTo those unfamiliar with The Big Game experience at WestGate you typically would get in line to watch the Superbowl in the theater portion of the hotel around 8 am on Superbowl Sunday. This line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves.So...after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater.No problem, something different, we said. Mistake.\\n\\nSo at 1:30 pm we were sent upstairs to the balcony to take our seats and prepare to watch the big game at 3:30. Once we take our seats one of us ( we're in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets.Please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater. BUT INSTEAD....\\n\\nWe were told by Westgate staff that no hand stamps or wristbands would be given and we were ON OUR OWN if we choose to leave and we would not be allowed back in. Wow.\\nThat's right, after waiting in line all morning if we wanted to go downstairs to play blackjack, place a bet at the book, or maybe have a bite to eat because no food was made available upstairs we would be out of luck. Nice work Westgate.\\n\\nSo we were seated upstairs...stuck. With no food or soda available for purchase. Only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter. That was at 1:45 p.m. After vigorously complaining to Westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3:04 pm wristbands were given out. At 3:18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony. I believe this was a direct result of all the upset patrons like myself that were seated in the balcony level.\\n\\nIn summary, for being the biggest sportbook in Las Vegas this place is dysfunction and fails to satisfy the most basic request to provide food and comfort to betting patrons. A total mess. This place sucks. Watch the big game and bet your money some where else. We will.\",\n",

We started off with the steak grilled skewers which were just Ok, nothing special. My freind got the lasagna and I got some special chicken dish. They were both pretty bland and lacking that kick. Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked. With such a big name attached to this restaurant and going on such an empty stomach we had such high hopes. The service was great which is why i gave it three stars.',\n",

       "  'text': \"We had dinner at the Bellagio Buffet last night. The service was OK. Our server was great but kind of forgot about us towards the end of our visit. The food was cold. The only good thing there was the crab legs because they're suppose to be cold and the tacos because it was freshly made. The food was under a single lamp that didn't heat the food at all. We let the server know that the food was cold and he told the manager that was in charge. All she did was come over to ask what the problem was and said she was going to talk to the chief. Have no idea what actually happened though because we didn't see her after that. Half the buffet was closed as well so there wasn't that many options. I must say i rather go to the Rio buffet. For a high end casino this was a horrible experience.\",\n",

We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!\",\n",

Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.\\n\\nFirst, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.\\n\\nI expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. \\n\\nTo top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.\",\n",

I explained what I wanted to the stylist, and even showed two photos. It's easy to get this cut wrong since it's short hair, so I also showed a photo of what exactly I DID NOT want. She asked what I didn't like about the photo and I explained it (it's a section in the back and she acted like she understood). The cut finishes, she spins me around and it is literally EXACTLY what I showed her that I didn't want. I was mortified and now trying to grow this hideous cut out. Nothing is blended and she butchered my hair. And to make matters worse, she wasn't even friendly! Heading to a different salon today to try and get it fixed.\",\n",

We started with the Foo Foo plater (just to be able to try a bit of everything). It was pretty good actually, I'd highly recommend it! Our server (i believe her name was Nicky) was super awesome and really nice and helpful. She decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls. The ramen was good, a little salty, but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll, which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize. We finally got it and it was okay, and they ended up comping it, which was nice. I'd give this place one more try...But I most limey wouldn't order the crispy rice roll again.\",\n",

Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home. Besides that, the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!\",\n",

Unfortunately, my wedding dress from David's had an alteration issue and the back of my dress ripped when I was finally trying it on for the last time the day before the wedding. Since we were on our way to get a tux fitting for my husband he thought it would be best to ask them if they can help us fix it because I was in tears since the dress was ripped so bad that my butt was hanging out. Britney picked us up at MGM and brought us and during conversation she did say let's look at the dress and see what can be done. Kelly and Brittany did just that, they quickly placed me in my dress while Taisha took my husband in to get his tux fitted. All while making sure he didn't see me.

       "  'text': 'Well they definitely lost me as a customer! RC Willey here I come!\\n\\nMy father, who is 69 years old, moved out here from Los Angeles the beginning of this month to be closer to me and my kids. I ordered and fully paid for a bedroom set for him. They called me like 4 days before the order was to be delivered to confirm the appointment. I advised the lady that no one was living in my father\\'s apartment yet but if they could call me as they are on their way I could rush down to the place and open the door for them. I mean I live in the same complex so it wouldn\\'t be a long wait! She said she would let the guys know but no promise...okaaaaay? I paid $1,200 for furniture, I am a repeat customer, and you can\\'t make one quick easy courtesy call? Well I missed their delivery and no call was made. I found out from my LANDLORD that they came because they went to the office and he was going to let them in but they said no because someone had to sign the paper. To top it off, when I got my dad\\'s key to check the place out before he arrived, there was a note on the COUNTER that said \"Sorry we Missed you\"....so they entered the apartment and left the note but couldn\\'t put the damn furniture together?? They denied going in but how the hell did the paper get on the counter? Anyway my dad arrived with NO furniture and we had to pay $50.00 for them to deliver the furniture again 3 DAYS LATER. My father has bad arthritis and basically no cartilage in his knees making it very hard for him to get up from low areas such as couches and FLOORS which he almost had to sleep on if it weren\\'t for my friend who let us borrow her air mattress luckily. He still couldn\\'t get up though and crawled to get around his place until I was able to get to his place after work :(. Bottom line, they are not for their customers at all and their attitude after you purchase their crap shows it all. I will never be back.',\n",

I thought it was expensive if you ask me. It was like $9. So it was over $20 with 2 specials and a drink. It didn't even fill you up for that kind of money!\\nThe soup comes in a small container and the sub is very small for being a half.\\nVery disappointed in how much came on the sub. They make them with their back to you and you can not see the items they put on and they don't even ask what you want on it. They just proceed to make it the way they want.\\nI can honestly say you get so much more for your money at Subway for much less and you can make the sub the way you want and you get very full and sometimes even have leftovers!\\nThe soup was hot and had a good flavor but such a small container and they fill just above half. We didn't get much at all.\\nOver all not our favorite sub place. Not happy. Not sure if we would go back here.\",\n",

Let me explain...\\n\\nThere are not many \"old\" restaurants in this town. We don\\'t seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn\\'t show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There\\'s an \"Old Western Vegas\" feel to Bob Taylor\\'s. Established in 1955, it\\'s the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor\\'s offers. \\n\\nFOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I\\'d be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? \\n\\nI\\'ll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn\\'t even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  \\n\\nI ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it\\'s because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. \\n\\nA few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. \\n\\nSERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. \\n\\nI won\\'t be back, but I\\'m glad to have visited this historic spot.\\n\\nService: 4 stars\\n\\nKitch: 4 stars\\n\\nFood: 1 star',\n",

We decided to go to Tryst.  Sammy was very patient in taking multiple phone calls and answering all my questions, even throwing in a couple of extra perks at my request.  The pre-pay service is great--the company takes the total cost of the evening and divides it per person, creating a link online where each girl can go and pay ahead of time.  We didn't have to deal with a large bill or everyone's credit cards at the end of the night.  It was SO easy.\\n\\nSomeone from the company was in constant contact with me leading up to our night out.  Sammy, knowing how large of a group we had and how important a good table was to us, called me the night of to let me know they'd had a different, better table open up, and that he was giving it to us at no extra charge.  \\n\\nCraig was our host for the evening.  He contacted me promptly to provide detailed instructions on where to meet him and when.

Craig stopped back a couple of times before leaving to make sure we were settled and having a good time.\\n\\nI contacted Sammy a couple more times throughout the weekend for various things, and he was more than helpful even though we weren't using them for additional reservations or nights out.  \\n\\nPlanning ahead is the way to go when it comes to Vegas, and while I don't think you HAVE to use an outside VIP company to plan, I don't really see a disadvantage to doing so.

       "  'text': \"Oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist, god awful, do not go. I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.\\n\\nWe walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  \\n\\nMy family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  \\n\\nIn the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.\",\n",

There's a solid array of cardio equipment, weight machines, and free weights (including an Olympic lifting platform/power cage combo with bumper plates, another power cage, and a Smith machine). \\n\\nThe pros: \\n24 hours access with your keycard\\nno-contract membership options\\nlockers (bring your own lock)\\nsweat towels provided\\nfriendly employees \\n\\nThe cons: \\nno showers\\ninconsistent membership rates (my friends got quoted several different rates than what I pay) \\nSmall space can get packed\\nSome of the equipment is showing signs of wear (ripped pads on weight machines and cracks in the weight benches pads and the numbers have rubbed off on some of the dumbbells, so you can't tell what the weight is. I wouldn't think it would be that hard to slap some stickers on there but it's been that way for months. \\noften dirty - especially the mirrors in front of the power cages which ALWAYS have peoples' spit sprayed all over them. I have personally wiped weird black/brown splotches off the Olympic lifting platform (are people shitting themselves during squats??) and it's always built up again the next time I go.\\n\\nOverall it's a decent gym that gets the job done if you live in the area.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"The service was pretty bad. There were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty. Then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible. When we ask to sit closer they say no. We ask why and they say no one is covering that area. Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception, I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any. \\n\\nLuckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas. \\n\\nThe food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas, definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's, but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas. \\n\\nOne really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great. \\n\\nDefinitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go.\",\n",

You can either go to a customer service rep or use their self-serve kiosk, which is what I ended up doing.\\n\\nThe lady who was assisting me on the kiosk phone was pretty friendly, but she was doing a lot of up-sell so it was kind of bothersome.  I didn\\'t need a bigger car than an economy size since there was only 2 of us.  I understand that they probably work off of commission, but sometimes it\\'s unnecessary to try and convince you to get something that you don\\'t need.\\n\\nThe return process was pretty quick and easy as well.  I ended up getting charged for an extra day because I brought the car back 1.5 hours after the pick up time since my flight didn\\'t leave until 8 PM.  Too bad they don\\'t have a \"grace\" period for regular customers.\\n\\nOther than that the car was fine.  I didn\\'t get anything fancy, just a KIA so nothing much to write about--other than the fact that it was clean and didn\\'t smell bad like some other rentals that I\\'ve encountered elsewhere.',\n",

We picked this over Chippendales cuz the idea of Australian men with their accents is so much hotter than American dancers =P. When I called in to purchase tickets an hour before the show, they said that they didn't have a table to fit 5 girls, and that we would have to separate into two tables, which was fine. But when we got there, there was 2 completely empty tables in the front of the stage! The sales people were really unorganized to not notice that was available! So we ditched our booth and went straight to the front table, which gave a much better view.\\n\\nThe show was def entertaining, with finely sculpted men ripping off their shirts and dressing up in firemen/spartan outfits ;) The occasional view of g-strings was not as welcome, something about a man in a g-string is just wrong, you know? but nonetheless, it was very entertaining. The emcee's accent was hot, and so was his bod. i think i found him the most attractive out of all the guys. They pulled a lot of the bachelorettes and birthday girls onstage to participate, and some of the older women too, which i thought was cool. They also ran around through the audience as well, so no matter where your seats were, I think you'd be able to get up close with one of the guys.\\n\\nDownside though, at the end of the show, you are welcome to go to the front of the stage and pay $20 PER PERSON to take a pic with the guys, only to receive one picture. no offense, but that is a total rip off. i've been to Fantasy, which is a female stripshow,  and you can take pics with them for free, and they had much better attitudes and were a lot friendlier to talk to after the show. They were annoyed that we had stood in like and decided against taking the picture after the show, and even more annoyed when a girl behind us asked if they took credit card. wtf? These men seemed way too jaded and full of themselves. They may be good to look at, but off-stage they're total jerks.\\n\\nWas this a good show? It was ok, it was entertaining and interactive, which i thought was nice. would i go again though? probably not. Next time, i'm trying chippendales. maybe their attitudes will be better.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Mr Cool Heating and Air Conditioning came to the rescue for me on short notice AND was able to work on a swamp cooler, which many companies do not. \\n\\nWe have three dogs of our own and we foster dogs, so when it started to heat up here in Vegas we were worried when the swamp cooler didn't seem to be blowing out air as cold as it normally does. I started reading reviews and messaging companies on yelp to see who, if any, would work on Swamp Coolers. The answer is, very few do, and most of the ones that do charge a high fee just to come take a look and provide an estimate, and often that fee doesn't apply towards the repair cost. Mr Cool didn't charge me an estimate fee and they had Derek come out to my house the very next day. Derek was thorough and investigated the problem and explained everything that was wrong without being condescending or acting like I was clueless. He offered his estimate for service and even told me I could shop around for other estimates to be certain I was getting a good price. I had already shopped around a bit so I was happy to proceed with their help. \\n\\nSwamp cooler parts are very large so they don't have space to keep them in their vans, but Derek assured me he could buy the parts and complete the repair the very next day. I explained that my husband and myself would need to wait until Friday when we were getting paid for repair and he was kind enough to work with us so we could come to an arrangement for payment so we wouldn't have to deal with our house being so hot. He came back the next day and was here for a good amount of time as swamp coolers take more time for repair and he was very thorough and explained everything to me again. I asked questions about how to best maintenance our swamp cooler and he was happy to answer. I'm very glad we chose Mr Cool and would HIGHLY recommend Derek as he was so patient, kind, and hardworking. Swamp coolers are a pain for repair so if they were affordable for our repair I'm sure they're even better with AC units. Thank you Derek and Mr Cool, our house gets soooo cold now, just how I like it!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.\\n\\nIt's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.\\n\\nService was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again.\",\n",

I will make sure with a HUGE online review on EVERY Review site that this place is NOT the place to take a Car... or a peddle bike for that matter..\\n\\nI replaced the o-rings, pulled the diode and got the ac working after I vacuumed it and refilled, what armatures..  I guess I got to go to ford, spend $80 on a new Power steering Bottle and tell LKQ to send me the money..\\n\\nWhen they first got my car knowing it was under warranty from LKQ they tried to get me to pay them the other $45 per hour on top of the $55 an hour they were getting under warranty... I told them do not touch it until I contact LKQ, they tried to scam me out of $45 an hour x12 hours.... I am not stupid..  LKQ should have pulled it out right there and then, but no.. they agreed to do it for the $55 an hour, but the skill these guys have isn't worth Minimum wage..\",\n",

This place rocks!!!\\n\\nOut of all the places in Las Vegas to pick for Cinco de Mayo food, drinks, and music, we picked this one based on YELP reviews.  We were first time visitors.  We will definitely return very soon!  \\n\\nWe arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people.  By the time we left, we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  Drinks aside, we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  We ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp.  It is more than enough for 2 people.  My hubs and I made 7 fajitas from the meat.  We can't speak to any of the other food.  OH WAIT!  Now I remember, we had an AMAZING desert.  A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries.  It was DELISH!!  \\n\\nWe met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler.  Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town.  Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   Our server was very friendly and the service was great!\\n\\nThe Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.  They were very good!  \\n\\nThis is a place worth visiting!  Good food, good drinks, good prices, and good service!  Locally owned.  Flaming Fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!\",\n",

What is so surprising is that most Chinese restaurants inside the hotels & casinos really are sub-par. The very basic essence of clean, fresh and friendly is the definition here, and the food is quite authentic. The servers work quite hard and there is a decent presence of managenent staff to ensure smooth operations. The XO sauce is very tasty, but be careful if you order it on the side as they will charge you for it (not exactly cheap). Still, I have been quite pleased with the food & service upon every visit for a number of years now. Definitely recommend -',\n",

       "  'text': \"I had two different experiences with Carpet Monkey. In both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when I needed to. Also, they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way. This is a great help since I had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were. Their price was also quite good since I requested 4 rooms upstairs, hallway, stairs, and downstairs bedroom. Now the first experience I had was on 09/15. The person who came to clean was Mark. I was not satisfied at all with his work. He didn't clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house. The stairs looked worse than before he came. There were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried. Any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he's been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn't really listen to our concern. In a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since I chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great. The work I had gotten done on 09/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like. However instead of rushing to yelp I figured this company doesn't have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09/20. This is where I can really appreciate this company's commitment to customers. When I called I believe the owner picked up. If I remember correctly his name was Rick. I told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that I wasn't satisfied at all with Mark's work. He said he'll send his right hand man Joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09/22. Again communication is very easy with this company. On top of that Rick told me the second visit wouldn't be of charge. So Saturday comes and we get a phone call from Isaac saying he's on his way, again great communication. I didn't worry too much that it wasn't Joe at our door like I was told since Isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn't satisfactory. He let me show him where I wasn't satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn't come out and said he'll go over all the areas. I was surprised since I thought he'd just go over the areas with spots only. But he went over everything all over again and everything looked A LOT better. The stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and Isaac also went ahead and did the risers which I wasn't expecting. There were some stains that wouldn't come out but he had mentioned that to us. Overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren't nearly as crunchy when dried after Isaac went over them. He also put the corner protectors on the wall which I appreciated (something Mark didn't do). So my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that. This alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better. Second experience with Isaac was WAY better and communication with the company is a breeze. Thank you Isaac and Rick!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'We ate here for a friend\\'s birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It\\'s a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.\\n\\nI ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn\\'t even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.\\n\\nI also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. \\n\\nThey brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote \"Happy Birthday\" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.\\n\\nYes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed. This is an incredibly unique, delicious restaurant.',\n",

If you read the reviews carefully, you\\'ll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I\\'m telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)\\n\\nThere was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don\\'t allow \"oversized\" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It\\'s insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I\\'m sure there\\'s some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn\\'t tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn\\'t around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn\\'t let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.\\n\\nOK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone\\'s there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn\\'t pay for that space though.  So suck it up and pay or else stay at your hotel pool (which was also awesome at Aria).',\n",

It's a quick walk to all the action (about 5 to 10 minutes to the Flamingo depending on how quick you pound the pavement).  \\n\\nThe suites are large, well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room, we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.\\n\\nKinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.\\n\\nI never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet, and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).\\n\\nThe restaurant at the hotel served fairly yummy food at great prices (service was a little slow at times), but what was EVEN BETER was the KILLER Happy Hour at the lounge.  Every day from 4 to 8 with half off all their appetizer menu, signature cocktails, wines by the glass, bottles that are sold by the glass, and then a selection of bottles that are served half off all day, all night. \\n\\nWe frequented the happy hour several times during our trip, and we were stoked every visit.  \\n\\nWe plan on making this our home next time we stop in Vegas.

Something in the neighborhood of $48 i think, but if you go to the Tix4Tonight or similar vendors you can buy a voucher for $2 that gets you into the buffet for $33 and change, so a total of $35... a $10 savings. A bottle of OK wine is 12 bucks and this becomes a really fun evening. Some complain that the food isn't prepared like some 5 star restaurant, but guess what... This isn't a 5 star restaurant... it's a decent buffet where you can try a little or a lot of everything. It's just fun, and a lot cheaper than those fancy chef name places in the hotels. Oysters,  crab, all kinds of fish and shellfish and lobsters. They have all of this and lots of veges and other dishes. I really like the dessert selection but admittedly,  when I am full of wine, crab, scallops and oysters the deserts start looking less attractive. Food critics, say what you like... the restaurant that fills up nightly for years and years is doing something that real people like!

Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.\\n\\nI've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.  It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.\\n\\nI've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.  \\n\\nOf the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.   \\n\\nThe only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.\\n\\nI have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?\\n\\nBut alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn't resist.\",\n",

Festive. But then again thats what you find at every mexican restaurant.\\n\\nThe hostess sat us quickly. 1 star for that. lets just state.. I HATE WAITING. especially if the place isn't busy. \\n\\nQuick, friendly service. Lady explained to us the specials and what different words meant that i hadn't heard before. Add, 1 more star.\\n\\nDidn't try the chips, salsa or bean dip. I'm just not one to fill up on that stuff then take two bites of my food. No, i wanted to have a empty stomach for my meal so that i could write about my experience. [yes, i know im just brilliant, no need for the pat on the back]\\n\\nThe food came and it was hot. It was delicious, mostly cause i was starving.. but it wasn't something that was spectacular. My mother in law makes better beans and rice. The taco cracked as soon as i took a bite. Thats another pet peeve. Inside I cried a little.. Now all the meat cheese and lettuce was going to fall out. Well, that ruined my taco experience. Boo. The chile relleno was delish. Cooked to perfections and de-seeded, just the way I like it. Adding 1 more star just for the chile relleno. Overall it was good\\n\\nWould have given it another star but this place is way over priced. Can we say expensive. Especially because this place isn't on the strip. Their prices are the same as Gonzalez Y Gonzalez and they're portions aren't as big or as good. Sorry Viva Mercados, I will not be coming back.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'OK, my first yelp review, so bear with me. I tend to break things down into categories, so I\\'ll go with that for now.\\nAtmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom\\'s or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it\\'s due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn\\'t recommend it for an romantic/intimate one. \\nService: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here.\\nFood (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife\\'s filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal.\\nFood (value): And here\\'s why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this \"ironic\"; I say, \"tacky!\" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn\\'t warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting \"Go back to Denny\\'s\", I\\'m talking value, not price. My last two steakhouse meals (Silverado and Circus Circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal.\\nSo, all in all, good, not great, and not worth the price.',\n",

First off, so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard, let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's.\\n  Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...\\n    Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).  \\n   So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.\\n  Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas.\\n~G\",\n",

       "  'text': \"When looking up hotels to stay in, I was skeptical about this and many other hotels, as one usually is in a city the've never visited. However, I was extremely pleased with my stay at Platinum.\\n\\nLocation: Located next to an AM/PM gas station. This was great because I could pregame on the cheap before we went to various places. The hotel is very visible but still in the cut. About a half mile or so from the Venetian.\\n\\nCustomer Service: When I walked in, I was greeted with warmth. It was about 1 am, so not many people were in the lobby. Which was actually the case throughout my entire trip. I chatted with the front desk associate like we were old friends. He was just that nice. And he made me feel so welcome!\\n\\nRoom: Can I tell you that this room was EVERYTHING in LIFE?! Ok. There I told you. I was in room 402 I believe. This room was in fact a suite. I felt like it was an apartment and I had a lease. Freaking HUGE! It had separate areas for a kitchen (complete with full fridge, stove / oven, microwave, dishwasher and bar), living room, balcony, bedroom with 2 queen beds, a safe, closet and tv and bathroom with closet, garden tub, separate bathroom and double sink vanity. The bathroom was the size of most rooms. Completely clean!!!!\\n\\nI stayed in it by myself. What a wondrous time!!!!!!! I had everything I needed and then some. And the view! Perfect view of the strip. It's the perfect way to be a part of Vegas without all the noise and smoke you get in a hotel with a casino. At half the price. Or less, depending on when you go. My first night in Vegas was spent relaxing in my beautiful room.\\n\\nTip: Even if you can't go get a full massage or service at the spa, at least purchase a cupcake bath salt from them and use in that beautiful tub. So relaxing!\\n\\nI will def be bringing my sister and cousin back this March! Can't wait!\\n\\nIm sure I left something out but you get the gist right? If not....stay here!! You won't regret it!\",\n",

We like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces. My husband and I really enjoy it and plan on returning. \\n\\nPros: \\n\\n* Friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter \\n* Clean and modern decor with plenty of seating/table options and large windows\\n* Large TVs (we watched football during one of our visits) \\n* Combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw\\n   Fries: skinny, crispy, salty, and plentiful | Coleslaw: a bit bland for my taste\\n* Their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning. \\n  Their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun) \\n  We do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming \\n* Their Boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable\\n* Their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable\\n* Milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken\\n* Honey Dipping Sauce options: wildflower, chipotle and wasabi honey flavors \\n  I LOVE all their honey options for my chicken tenders \\n* Other Dipping Sauce options: habanero hot sauce and their own BRBBQ barbecue dip\\n* Lunch Box Special Deal:  M-F |  11am - 4pm  | 3 whole wings, fries, and a drink = 8 bucks \\n\\nCons: \\n\\n* It seems a bit pricey for what it is. Essentially, it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint. You're looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos. However, I do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints. It's an upscale atmosphere for a 'fast casual' restaurant.  \\n\\nReview 1 for 2017\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company, fun entertainment, and delicious food!!! I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event. \\n\\nWe had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) \\n- Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) \\n- A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)\\n- Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  \\n- Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. \\n- Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! \\n- Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) \\n- MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! \\n- 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.  \\n\\n***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol \\n\\nOVERALL RATINGS:\\nFood - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)\\nFood (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars! \\nDrink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio\\nPresentation - 4 stars\\nService & Ambiance - 4 stars\\n\\nI gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!\",\n",

The only good thing that I was blown away by is their Fried Calamari.  That was a pretty legit dish.  Their biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich I believe i can get somewhere else for cheaper and made better.  We also got their Caesars Salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap \"free range\" chicken breast that was grilled.  Overall not too impressed with what they served.  And this is on a hunch but if bread was given to everyone as an opener then they most def didn\\'t care for us.  Everyone else had bread on their tables but us, don\\'t know if you had to order it or not.  \\n\\nAgain, overall the place is well lit and looks great.\\n\\nFoodwise....id go somewhere else.

I was offered a sample while working and was told he could bring the food into me at my convenience but I didn't take advantage assuming that I would be able to catch him outside and take a look at my options. Unfortunately for me as I was walking out of the building Steven was pulling away. He saw me though, and as I expressed my sadness in missing my opportunity. He so kindly and without hesitation pulled over and prepared me the dish of my choosing. He was so gracious and even gave me a small story of how he got started.

Yes, there are clubs better than TAO, and better restaurants than the Grand Lux, but those hotels with don't have great service or great decor or rooms as the Venetian. It's like some hotels focus on one great trait (day club, night club, room accommodations), but the Venetian has it all across the board.

In addition to the usual sprouts, kimchi, etc. Island Style also gives you boiled peanuts which were a nice touch. I went wth cold noodles half and half for my meal. I really liked the dish, with each side offering a nice taste. I wish it could have been spicier but in the end I was contently full and very happy with my choice. $14 for the dining experience was well worth it. The restaurant itself had a very mom and pop feel and seemed authentic in every aspect. A very good option for eating in the area.',\n",

       "  'text': 'My husband and I drove by Rani\\'s a couple weeks ago and he said, \"International Market? That looks interesting.\"  So I made a note to check it out on Yelp later.  After reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed, \"$6 vegetarian Indian food? I want to go to there!\"\\n\\nSo that is how we wound up at Rani\\'s.  I immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (I\\'m a sucker for paneer), and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an Indian sweet to have while I waited.  She brought out our thali, which consisted of 2 roti, rice, dal, pickles, okra, an aloo-gobi-type yumminess, and I believe kofta (veggie dumplings).  The cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it.  Definite bonus points.\\n\\nEverything was fantastic, although I was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha.  This place is very casual, which I really like about it.  Don\\'t come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit-down Indian restaurant; instead, expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma\\'s kitchen.\\n\\nAfter we filled our bellies, we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store.  I hadn\\'t planned on buying anything, but when I found garam masala for super cheap, and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and couldn\\'t find, and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else)....well you get the picture.  Anything you would need for a well-stocked Indian pantry is here, and then some.    There\\'s also mint and tamarind sauces, bottled lassis, naan, and huge blocks of paneer.  Trust me when I say I seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home.\\n\\nI considered giving this place 4 stars, because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time.  But it was a Friday evening and there was an Indian soap opera on the TV I think we interrupted....So, obviously, I can\\'t blame them.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I remember coming to the Buffet at the Bellagio several years ago for Sunday Champagne Brunch and being blown away.   It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten.  Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered.  \\n\\nWell, we got off to a bad start.  My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.  At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed.  No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  My bad.\\n\\nAs for the adult meals, the food was fine.  I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My mother had the crab legs which she loved.  We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.  \\n\\nReally the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but I just can't help but feel like we over paid.  There was nothing remarkable offered.  The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.  I'm just not feeling the love for this place this time.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"AWFUL AWFUL PEOPLE! I'm only giving them one star because I can't post otherwise, but they're not even worth that. I used MovingAPT.com to find them - won't ever use them again either. I thought having an agent would prevent this kind of crap from happening. I don't even know where to start with my complaints; this entire move was a mess from the beginning due to lack of communications and professionalism. I paid extra for a specific move date and time, as well as a 'special handling fee' because of my piano. \\n\\nWhen they arrive for the pick-up - 2 days late 6 hours after they were supposed to be there - they didn't come prepared for a piano. My dad and uncle had to find 2x4's to use as a ramp and help the movers hold it and roll it off the porch. This is a stage piano, the wheels aren't really meant for rolling around cement! After loading everything and telling my parents they were headed my way (Virginia), my stuff is taken from Wyoming to Seattle, then back to Vegas where it was put in storage without my knowledge or permission. I only found out because I kept calling to see the whereabouts of the truck so I could plan accordingly. After repeated phone calls, and finally the threat of legal action, my items were put back on a truck and started the journey East. \\n\\nFinally, they call to tell me they'll be there on June xx, which is exactly during the 3-day window I said I would be out of the state and not be able to receive the truck - again, all covered BEFORE the contract was even signed. So I'm told if I can't get a friend to meet them at my house and let them in, they'd go on to New York with my stuff and I'd have to pay an additional fee to get it, whenever they brought it back to me, which would be at their discretion. Luckily, I was able to get a hold of someone and coordinate with them to receive the shipment, upon which he started taking pictures the moment the truck was opened. (see below). After they had unloaded everything and AFTER I had confirmed 3 times over the course of this month that they had the proper equipment, they realize that in fact, they don't have anything to move the piano. So they decide they'll go to Home Depot, hire random men, and carry/lift the piano into my house. You don't LIFT a piano! So my friend that's there says no, it's too heavy, you need the proper equipment, I suggest you go find it. So then they tell him that they need to get on the road to New York for their next job so they'll just go put my piano in a warehouse until I was back so I'd let them deliver it. Again, they're told no, at which point the driver calls me while I'm in the airport and says if I don't let them into my house I'd have to pay a second delivery fee. I told them not to leave the state with my piano and I'd call them right back - so I call my friend and ask what's going on; he gives me the scoop. I asked him if he'd run up the street - about 4 blocks from my house - and secure a storage unit that these guys could back the truck right up to the ramp, get the piano on a dolly and store it there for two days til I could get a professional. He said OK, and while I'm still on the phone, I hear him say exactly that to the driver. I call the driver back myself and say the same thing. I literally asked them to wait 15 minutes while we got this taken care of; he said OK. My friend leaves, gets the paperwork for a storage unit, comes back and these guys have unloaded the piano, ROLLED it down the sidewalk (no dolly), tried to lift it up my 4 steps, DROPPED it, eventually go it inside, and we're RUNNING TO THEIR TRUCK when my friend gets back. They hadn't given him the inventory sheets or had him sign anything, so he hollers at them and runs after. He had to jump in his own vehicle to chase them down and cut them off before they stopped. At that point they gave him the paperwork - still not signed - and took off again. \\n\\nAs soon as I got home that same evening I went right to the piano to take a look and started taking pictures. I called the driver and asked what had happened. He said nothing, everything was fine, no damage. I called BS and told him I'm standing in my living room looking at the damage. He hung up and I've never been able to get a hold of these people since.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Came here with a group of 20+ to see Morgan Page on 11/30/12.\\n\\nArrival: Got to the club around 11pm. Getting to the club was simple, took only around 15 minutes from the car to the lines (and that included a bit of pre-gaming)! \\n\\nEntry: Got my entire group on a guestlist with a 1:1 (guy/girl) comp until midnight. Sign up on their website and you will get a text back if you have been put on. The entry line was confusing as hell, with at least 4 different lines (staff, promoter, general, VIP). There was an open bar for ladies from 11-12 so things were a bit rushed. This came back to bite me in the ass as I made the mistake of leaving my guestlist line for the shorter staff entry line. Members of my group were with this female staff member who said could get us all free in even though our guy:girl ratio had more guys. I spoke with her personally to make sure of it before I left my line. Well...SHE LIED! The bouncers upfront simply took the first equal ratio of guys:girls, leaving me and another guy stuck paying $40 entry. My girlfriend was not pleased with the fact that one of my other group members (who came stag) got in for free and I didn't. Whatever, lesson learned. Don't rush in. Don't be tempted by an open bar or a shorter line. Stick with guestlist if you're approved. Make sure your group ratio is even or favors girls. Don't listen to otherwise!\\n\\nClub Layout: The club itself is very nice. Not quite as grand or spacious as XS next door, but a beautiful venue nonetheless. Main dance floor is average sized. It was spacious enough so that we didn't feel like canned sardines and had adequate room to dance. There are no stairs or steps to climb, a la Marquee, so ladies will appreciate this. The main room is flanked by a large tent-like area and the outdoor wading pool/patio area. The easiest accessible restrooms are outside as well (the indoor one gets crowded). The outdoor area is ideal for those who want to socialize more, take pictures, take a breather, etc. It's beautiful.\\n\\nBar: The indoor bar layout is terrible. There was maybe 10 feet between the bar and the backs of the booths for those who got tables. This 10 feet also serves as the main walkway to get to the tent and outdoor area. Not so surprisingly, there is a lot of pushing, bouncers shining lights and telling you to move, and it worst of all: it takes forever to get a drink! I said before to not by tempted by an open bar for ladies and here's why: this is the only bar ladies can get free drinks from! On top of that, ladies can only get one drink at a time! So ladies, if you planned to be here for an hour and get drunk or pass drinks to the guys, you'll be disappointed.The outdoor bar nudged in between the tent/outdoor area is empty and stress-free compared to the one inside, so I would recommend buying drinks from here. Drinks were typical Vegas prices so expect in the neighborhood of $15 per.\\n\\nOverall, I had a great experience at Surrender. The club was beautiful, my group had a blast, and Morgan Page (and his opener) rocked it! Learn from my mistake, stay away from the indoor bar, and come with great people and you will have one memorable night! 4/5.\",\n",

The host was very friendly and informed us that the restaurant was not opened for dinner yet.  My girl friend and I each had a a cocktail while we waited.  Wow! I loved their \"Socialite\" cocktail and my girlfriend was amazed by their \"lycheetini\".  Both drinks were incredible!! This definitely gave us a boost of confidence about the meal we were about to have. \\n\\nWhen it was time for dinner we picked a bottle of sparkling sake called \"hana awaka\"....it was sincerely the best sparkling sake we\\'ve ever had.  It was a little pricey (then again, what\\'s not pricey in Vegas?) but it was definitely an amazing experience to try something new! \\n\\nThe food, oh the food was just so incredible.  My favorites were hamachi jalapeno, hamachi tartar, miso cod lettuce cups, and uni.  All of the dishes have nice portion since it\\'s meant to be shared, which I thought was a great concept!  The food was just so fresh and nicely flavored we actually ordered some dishes again!  My girl friend and I were definitely in sushi heaven.  \\n\\nEveryone in the restaurant were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there.  The manager came to ask us twice to see if we were satisfied with the food and if we were having a good time.  My water never went below half empty as the water and busboy constantly refills it as soon as I drank some.  For someone who drinks a lot of water with my meal and so I\\'m constantly asking for more water, this is a huge plus for me.   \\n\\nThe ambiance was amazing.  We enjoyed the trendy music but it was not too loud we couldn\\'t hear our own conversation. \\n\\nOverall, we had an incredible experience dining at social house.

       "  'text': '7/15/17. Came to Vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and Saturday just seemed to want us to be at Encore Beach Club the entire day/night. First, we attended Diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. Came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles. You could see Diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the DJ. We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. \\n\\nAs more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn\\'t seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we\\'d want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us. \\n\\nWe got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. I was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as I forgot to tell the bank I was leaving the state. My Host Alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while I called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. She was calm and pleasant, and simply said \"this happens all the time.\" (This was in stark contrast to the treatment at Omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined). \\n\\nAlexia and her runner, damn I totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. She came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. They also made sure we stayed hydrated! Super important when it\\'s 100 at night. They gave us just the right amount of attention and class. \\n\\nThank you guys, and special thanks to Alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. Saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! Truly I don\\'t expect anything less from Encore/Wynn (XS, Surrender/Encore Beach Club) - I never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that I have both attended with tickets and tables. They are the best, they will always be the best. \\n\\nThanks again! :-)',\n",

       "  'text': 'As an ex-NYer, I have a pretty high standard of bagel. These did not disappoint, but I wouldn\\'t say they are truly singular in their yumminess. My review is based solely on these, as we did not try the desserts or anything else. Some of the bagels seemed \"fresher\" than others, and if you\\'ve ever had a NYC bagel before 8am, you know the expectations I have. I also feel like the bagels were kinda skinny, and the holes were big. I\\'m used to really fat, chewy but pillowy ones. Sigh.\\n\\nBut it really pains me to give anything lower than 4 stars, as they have a lot of traditional Jewish/NYC deli delicacies, which you really don\\'t see out here in LV. If that is your thing, you really should check it out! The rye bread with caraway seeds looked good. The dessert section also piqued my interest. Please don\\'t get a black & white cookie - Hell will freeze over before anyone ever likes those, trust me.\\n\\nThe shop is located in the weirdest shopping complex - it feels like a dr\\'s office belongs here. Inside, it was pretty poppin\\' (it was Sunday), but the line wasn\\'t bad. \\n\\nAll in all, I will be back again to try more.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Yeah I hear people always raggin\\' about the post office, but you know what gang? The postal service has the best deal anywhere in the world! You can ship stuff all over the world, it is cheaper to use the the US Postal Servie, then any of those private shipping companies - FedEx, UPS, DHL.........etc.\\n\\nLast month while I was in Las Vegas, I did a very quick trip just to watch my beloved Hawaii Warriors play football against UNLV.\\n\\nWhile I was in Las Vegas, I decided to go up with just a duffle bag for my luggage, as I was basically away for just 2.5 days.\\n\\nAs a professional traveler, I like to travel light, and if I take something with me on a trip..........I\\'ll be sure to use it! \\nDon\\'t you just hate it when you over-carry stuff & not use it? I\\'ve learned over the years from all my travels for work to \"travel efficiently\", and I hate carrying extra stuff.........because all you\\'re doing is lugging excessive weight!\\n\\nHow does the Post Office come into play? \\n\\nWell, on my trip I decided to got to Trader Joe\\'s (It\\'s a Hawaii thing.........we don\\'t have TJ in Hawaii).\\n\\nBut that\\'s not it gang..........sure, I could have carried some of the stuff I bought home (which I did), but due to security, & TSA rules.........if you buy anything \"liquid\" or \"paste\" it cannot be over 3 oz. when you do any kind of carry on.\\n\\nCatch my drift???\\n\\nSo after buying a few bottles of cookie butter for my sweetie (she likes that stuff), I realized I could not carry that onto the plane with me, so the next best thing to do.............yes gang! Go to the US Post Office, get one of them free - \"Flat Rate\" Boxes, load up all your junk that you bought (and make sure you pack it carefully if it\\'s fragile), then tape it up.........and ship it out to yourself! In this case.........back to da 808!\\n\\nWhaaaalaaaah! Not only was it cheaper to ship (even cheaper than paying for airline luggage, which usually runs from $25 to $35 dollars), but you don\\'t have to carry it home either! What a smart Hawaiian I am \\'eh!!!!! Lol!\\n\\nSo if you folks ever load up on omiyagi when you travel..............may I suggest this method to work around the dilemma you\\'re in.\\n\\nJust an FYI..........\\n\\nLarge Flat Rate Box cost only $17.90 to ship. If it fits........you can ship! \\n\\nMedium Flat Rate Box cost only $12.65 to ship. And again..........if it fits........you can ship!\\n\\nThis Post Office also has a automated kiosk, which is nice, because to can still ship items out when the post office is closed, or say you come here on a Sunday to ship something out (when the post office is closed). \\nIn my case...........I shipped my box out on Sunday, and used the kiosk! No problemo gang! Easy bruddah! Winning!!!!\\n\\nWhat a great service that the US Postal Service provides! MAHALO! :D',\n",

       "  'text': 'I dined at P.J.\\'s last weekend.  I had heard many great things about their food and service, so I had to check it out.  I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and that they have a little pseudo patio as well.  It was nice sitting out there and people watching all of the crazy people who come through the Forum Shops.  Our server was very friendly, but did seem a little awkward and didn\\'t make a lot of eye contact.  His recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed all of our food.  I over heard other servers asking tables where they were from, and it was a little overboard.  EVERY person who came to a table asked that question.  The poor table next to us must\\'ve answered 15 times.  Here is a little tip: if the hostess asks, she should then communicate it to the server. So when the server approaches the table he/she can say \"hey, I heard you are visiting from ____, welcome!\" Much more personal.\\n\\nAnyhow, on to the food!!\\n\\nWe started out sharing the french onion soup, a caesar salad and the tater tots.  All were delicious.  The croutons were homemade on the salad and very flavorful.  The soup was served in a litte crock and was very cheesy.  The tater tots were not my favorite in town, but they are still good.  They are homemade and served with tomato jelly instead of ketchup.\\n\\nMain Course:  I had the delmonico ribeye, oscar style.  The steak was done perfectly and the crab meat and bernaise were amazing.  I could barely eat 1/2 of my meat!  My guest had the lobster mac n\\' cheese, which is very different, but very delicious.  There was plenty of lobster meat and it was a large portion.  There was spinach, mushrooms and other things mixed in, which is different.\\n\\nWe had a side of asparagus, which was amazing.  Cooked perfectly al dente.  We also had the \"canon\" potato on the side, upon recommenation from our server.  I am SO glad I tried this.  It is actually an English food called \"bubble and squeak.\" Mashed potatoes are sauteed with bacon and chopped cabbage and then topped with a cheese sauce.  Sounds strange, but it was a great combination!  I would go back for that dish alone.\\n\\nFor dessert we shared the fresh apple cobbler topped with cinammon ice cream.  It was warm and delicious, like an apple pie fresh out of the oven.\\n\\nOverall, I love the place.  They have a raw bar that often has happy hour specials for $1 oysters.  It is not too casual, but also not fussy.  Everyone is very friendly and welcoming and the food is great!',\n",

       "  'text': \"My wife and I flew out to Vegas for the 3-Day President's Day weekend and my 50th birthday.\\nI reserved the car on-line at Hertz a few days earlier: A Mercedes C-Class from the prestige collection. I selected the Reserve This Exact Model option so that we would get a Mercedes.  I also signed up for the Hertz Gold membership so that our car would be ready for us and we would be able to skip the usually long counter lines at the McCarran Airport.  \\nNone of these things happened. \\nOur reservation was for 3:00.  At 2:48 I received an email confirmation that my car was ready for me and even given a stall # to find the car and license plate # to identify the car and even the color-white.  When we got to the stall there was a car, but not the car I had reserved and received confirmation for.  So, I explain my situation to a couple of workers that were walking by and they tell me that there was a Mercedes there earlier but somebody else got it.  Somebody else got it?  It was in a stall reserved for me, right?\\nOk, over to the office to STAND IN LINE anyway.  The counter worker tells me there are no Mercedes available.  I say I reserved one specifically (Choose Exact Model), one was supposedly waiting for me, and I had received an email telling me this.\\nHe tells me he has a better car for me:  A Cadillac.  We go out to see the Cad and I see a Mercedes, a white one, and I ask for it.  He tells me it's held for someone.  I say Yah, me.  He says he can't do it.  I ask why not.  He says it's on hold for someone else.\\nI ask why the car I had on hold went to someone else and he could not explain it.\\nWe look at the Cad and he tells me there are two to choose from and I would like it better than the Mercedes anyway.  Is that why there were 2 Cadillacs and 0 Mercedes available?\\nAnyway, I agreed to take the Cadillac but was left wondering what is so great about Hertz and their Gold Club?  I had to wait in line, I did not get the car I reserved and was PROMISED.\\nTime to start shopping around for a new rental car company.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"My boyfriend and I were really looking forward to a couple's massage on our vegas trip this memorial day weekend. I researched a lot of spas and reviews before choosing Episage, and I'm so glad I made the right decision. First of all, I called 5 different times to see if I could reschedule our appointment since our flight and times wouldn't allow us to make our original one. Each time they tried to find a new opening for us, and even a few hours before we went they scheduled us on a Sunday after I called. Nikki and Limmie were our therapists. They went above and beyond expectations for a massage!! They set the music to that that would fit my bf and I perfectly. They taught us (mistly my bf) all about tight and knotted fascia and stretching. Limmie went through a number of stretches and flexibility therapies on me. They had us laughing and having a good time the entire session, and we got educated without even realizing we were getting educated. My boyfriend is making sure he's stretching and treating his body better now after the session with Nikki and Limmie, and I now can't wait to come back to Vegas just to go see them for another massage! Best hour and a half ever! You won't be disappointed!!\",\n",

The standard dishes - chinese broccoli, xiu mai, ha cao, chicken feet, black bean pork ribs, steamed bbq pork bun, shrimp wrapped in thick rice noodle, chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle - were all a-ok.  The rice and chicken served in a vertical bamboo cup was tasty; flavors were similar to Vietnamese 'com ga', with ginger, light soy, and chicken.  The xiu mai had orange/yellow 'eggs' on it which tasted like crab innards/tomal/mustard; rich and super flavorful.  All the dumplings were packed with meat and/or seafood and not a lot of fillers (yay!).  The only downside is that the offerings are limited/uninspired; just the basics.  I'd come back if I were in LV and craving dim sum.\\n\\nOther important info: small establishment, push cart servers, prices are higher than CA but definitely reasonable, located inside Gold Coast Hotel off the Strip next to RIo and across from the Palms.\",\n",

After that, I began coming here for my morning cardio (walk/run/hike) several days a week. \\n\\nI agree with many of the reviews for this park. It has a little bit of everything and more. \\n\\n- A bad ass playground I wish existed during my childhood. \\n\\n- A huge grassy area for picnics, soccer, and just laying out to relax, read a good book, write or draw. I've seen some photographers do their photo sessions here. \\n\\n- There is a path way to a small mountain, great for a short hike. \\n\\n   It's a great hike if you want to do a solo hike in the morning. Every morning that I've been here there were others hiking the trail, doing their morning cardio/workouts as well. So I felt safe knowing that there were others around if I accidentally fell or what not. \\n\\n- There is no cement trail up and down the mountain.  It's just dirt and gravel. So be careful.\\n\\n- There are different pathways up and down the hill for the adventurous souls. (Not recommended for beginners. Check out the trail first before you go exploring :-) ) \\n\\n- There are two levels up the mountain. So you can rest at the 1st level. It has a shaded picnic table and a great view of the city. \\n\\n- At the top, there's a huge platform with an amazing view of the city. With a little bit of Nevada history. It's peaceful at the top. And reminds me why I love nature and this city. \\n\\n- Some people do their Tai Chi and/or meditation in the morning. Either at the top of the mountain or in the park.  It's peaceful to watch. \\n\\n- There's a small cement stage at the other end of the park. I'm guessing for plays and performances during the warmer months. \\n\\n- Bathrooms are clean and stocked every morning. \\n\\n- Great park to bring your doggies and fur buddies as well. \\n\\n*** Tip: If you don't live in Mountain's Edge & you're coming from I-15/Blue Diamond or 215/Buffalo, it's on Buffalo road & you'll have to make a U-turn to get to the entrance of this park.\",\n",

I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, \"The Buffet\" as it\\'s now known has declined quite a bit in quality.\\n\\nFirst, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren\\'t bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.\\n\\nI hope this buffet gets their act together soon. Sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at TI in a long time and I couldn\\'t stand the smell of the casino!

They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.\\n\\nI get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)\\n\\nSo here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:\\n\\nThere is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???\\n\\nThe lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.\\n\\nIf you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.\\n\\nLock box is available for $20 by the entrance.\\n\\nNot going back.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here.\\nAlso, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone. Just text him! He is AMAZZZINNNGG. He will walk you in, he will make sure you're all good and he will answer all your questions. Just went to Vegas this past weekend and had a blast.\",\n",

We\\'ve lived on Maui for a few years now, and it\\'s almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.\\n\\nWe were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.\\n\\nAfter we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.\\n\\nWe also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I\\'ve ever had.\\n\\nFor our main meal, we took our server\\'s suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible. \\n\\nWe ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.\\n\\nEarlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can\\'t choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I\\'ll have to take them up on their offer.\\n\\nAmazing food, wonderful service.  You won\\'t be disappointed at Onda.',\n",

All tables are well cared for and while there's always a handful of tables that are broken they seem to actually fix them. Ample parking and low table prices. $5 or $10 bucks will get you plenty of play time. It's not walkable from the strip, but a cab or Lyft wouldn't be too expensive as you're just to the east.

My 23 year old garage door finally gave up the ghost the other nite. I got quotes from some competitors ranging from 750.00 to 1,100.00 dollars. Both companies came immediately said I needed a new door. I expressed to them by budget was limited and a new door wasn't in that budget. A friend said contact AAA Action Doors. Contacted Josh (part owner)...Told him my budget was limited. He came out took one look at the door,..Said we got this it can be repaired w/o question..All that was needed was new metal bracing along the top and middle. He installed the metal bracing in less than 45 min....I had an operating door again..and saved a bunch of money.\",\n",

That said, some experiences stand out more than others. Recently moving to Las Vegas from Denver, I was nervous about finding a new stylist. I was loyal to my Aveda stylist in Denver for over 5 years and loved every cut, color, and experiment.\\nToday I took the plunge and scheduled a haircut as I desperately needed about a foot of hair chopped.\\nI met Jessica, and she immediately put me at ease. She listened to my stories of how my hair has changed over the course of a pregnancy, she understood my challenges as a busy mom, and she wisely offered advice on some face framing and bang maintenance.\\nShe was funny, smart and personable.\\nAnd that's just the beginning of Jessica's amazing work.\\nAfter relieving me from about 4 pounds of hair, Jessica so beautifully framed my face and shaped my hair to a magnificent style.\\nPlease don't miss this salon. From the massaging shampoo chairs to the fabulous stylists, they will leave you looking your best.\",\n",

For food that includes sandwiches and salads, you are paying in the teens for each dish. Drinks are equally expensive. \\nService is hit and miss (from my 3 visits).

I am almost embarrassed to say what a difference they made on my tiles.  Night and day.  I've been in my house for 10 years regularly have it cleaned however I've never had my tiles steamed and chemically cleaned like they performed and what a difference, I'm so happy.  \\nI just happen to find them via reading some reviews on yelp and thought that I'd give them a shot I am so glad I found them.

       "  'text': \"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.\\n\\nIndeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  \\n\\nThe property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.\\n\\nWe went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again.\",\n",

I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist  and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken!\\n\\nI ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing.\\n\\nOnly issue: portion sizes are little small compared to the usual American size portions. But it was a treat!\",\n",

I also love the Harry & David store for gourmet foods.\\n\\nLook for Starbucks in one of the middle aisles for caffeine. The food options inside are dismal, but there are some okay food options in the parking lot in front of the mall.\\n\\nThis place can get really busy. I find the mall to be pleasant for an hour or two after opening, but just generally miserable after that time. I would recommend planning out which stores you'll visit and setting time limits to get the heck out of Dodge before all hell breaks loose.\\n\\nThe parking lot can be insane. As a local I can say that I hate even driving by here in the middle of the day during my lunch break. Wow, there is a lot happening here. People jaywalking, tourists making crazy lefts onto Warm Springs (just use the LV Blvd. exit!), and just general chaos. I do occasionally come here on my lunch break, but I park in a secret lot to avoid the chaos. No, I'm not telling where that is or how I get there. :)\",\n",

Whatever the hell that means, I just made it up. Sounds weird huh? Just look at the pics it\\'s truly lovely. The chandelier that everyone takes pics of and talks about is magical.\\n\\nThe menu is a more causal (Sage like) menu. Modern American Fusion? Who cares about the title. It\\'s just good food. \\n\\nWe have not ordered entrees here YET because we have already had dinner or were on our way to dinner on our visits. \\n\\nThey said that they can accommodate to vegan for us no problem. I look forward to a pasta or a special custom creation. The items that we have had (so far) are very good.\\n\\nPortobello fries, flat bread, salads....wine, wine, and more wine :)\\n\\nThe service is super accommodating, almost too much service. I guess because they are newer they want to help and help a lot. Lol. \\nThe over-service was only in the dining area. In the lounge the service is perfect.\\n\\nI truly love the way the did the garage door in the lounge and the way the patio area looks.\\n\\nI really want to sit in that left hand side back lounge booth with a ton of people. It\\'s really soooo big it could fit 10+++ people. I love it. Their left side dining area private table would make a large gathering super fun.  \\n\\nI will update when we order full entrees and remember to take more pics since we are here soo much. \\n\\nJust go, it\\'s a marvelous addition to the beautiful SW area.

       "  'text': \"I was stationed in Nevada in 2012 and relied heavily on Verizon. Horrible mistake. No service in my dorm or anywhere on that block. I spent $500 on a brand new galaxy s4. After about a year, everything started deteriorating. GPS stopped working, service got worse, and miscellaneous files took up most of the space on my phone.\\n\\nVerizon's fix? Spend $800 om a new phone. An A1C in the USAF makes about $17k their first year, so a new phone was out of the question. I replaced the antennas and restored service, but then It happened again; this time replacing things didn't work. I haven't been able to use my GPS in 4 years. I can't put anymore files/pics/songs on my phone because I have 20 GBs in random files that can't be erased.\\n\\nThe service is unbearable. I went to San Diego with my girlfriend to visit her family. I had a phone interview because I was a few weeks from separating from the mil. There wasn't any service anywhere. I drove around for 45 mins looking for service. Found it, but something malfunctioned and instead of the call going through as I stared at my phone, a voice mail popped up. I tried calling back, but all the bars dropped to zero. This was a nightmare. Ultimately, I didn't get the job, presumably because I hadn't prepared myself for the interview with better service.\\n\\nIt's gotten to the point where I stay at home all the time incase a company calls about a job. It's the only place in las vegas thag I get signal. I don't even get service in the Verizon store.\\n\\nTheir fix? Get a ne phone. Create a problem. Sell a solution. How come my laptop doesn't malfunction because of its age? I use it more than my phone because it's more reliable. The UAVs we flew had data link systems that rarely, if ever, had to be changed.\\n\\nI think Verizon raises attenuation on old phones or somehow disrupts service to force users to buy another phone.\\n\\nEither way, worst service ever. Once I start my new job, we're all getting AT&T.\",\n",

The brisket was fall apart tender on top of Texas toast, abundantly garnished with cabbage. The mixed fries accompanying the brisket were like hot thick BBQ chips, delicious.

This time we decided to stay at THEhotel and without a doubt we have found our Vegas home. Check-in was friendly and helpful. We arrived about 10:30 and they checked our bags so we could go to the pool and then called when our room was ready. Friends had raved about the pool @ Mandalay and they were right. The wave pool and lazy river combo kept our daughter entertained for hours. We ate/drank everyplace by the pool and what we really liked is not only the friendliness of the staff, but how we didn't feel milked for every last penny. Food, drink, lattes and pastries in the morning and dinner at House of Blues were all very reasonable and help to guarantee that we'll be taking the trip back more often. The Junior Suite is more than enough room for our family and that space was helpful so we could relax as a couple and as a family. Bell and valet service was extremely prompt. All in all a great time and it looks like we've found our home in Vegas :)\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This is going to be long...I\\'m sooo satisfied with the customer service my boyfriend and I received from Jesus! Our stroller was bought as a gift online for $560. Now it was online for $399 so I called the Target.com phone number since the stroller was purchased online and asked for a price adjustment. They said I would have to put my stroller back in the box, return it in store or mail it back, & repurchase online to get the credit & they would ship me another stroller. Kind of a hassle but I thought $160+ was worth it. So when I got off work, I look up the stroller online to make sure it\\'s still available and it is NOWHERE to be found on the Target website. I call the online number, spoke to 2 different people and both said I could purchase through the phone at the price I saw online, $399. So I box the stroller back up, drive to my nearest Target, explain to Jesus & what does he do? Dismiss everything I explained, he asks me to login to my registry, scans the stroller box & says, \"Whoa! That\\'s a lot of money!\" Refunds to a gift card $611.48, scans it again, tells me it\\'s now $279.96. I was like, \"okay!\" Obviously I wasn\\'t going to argue with that price when I was originally going for the \"$399.99\" price. Lol He hands me my gift card and tells me, you have a credit of $308.84 left on the gift card. I thank him and we walk out with our stroller. Definitely a big score! I had been dreading the inconvenience of having to wait to get my other stroller in the mail. So walking out with my same stroller was awesome. I went home and set it up again & I also ended up purchasing our baby monitor and glider from the Target website with the credit we received. I could not be happier. :)\\n\\nAbout 3 days later, I walked in to return a baby bath tub for store credit. I received 5 for my baby shower so I was looking to see where some had been purchased since I hadn\\'t gotten gift receipts. Once again, Jesus helped me out. Super friendly, super fast, no hassles! \\n\\nKeep up the good work Jesus!',\n",

Montreal for the record is a foodie wonderland. \\n\\nAlthough this restaurant is priced high, in Vegas terms I would say it's average. The service, ambiance and location are exceptional and the food couldn't be more perfect. I usually have some sort of critique on what could be better, and this time all I can say is that if they could make the meal never end. \\n\\nThe best way to experience Milos is via their tasting menu. I started with their grilled octopus which is one of the best I've had (other than in Montreal of course). The flavor and texture of their octopus is just right and the portion perfect. \\n\\nFor my main I went with the lobster pasta, which was equally delicious as my starter and equally well executed. If I could eat this dish every day, I would. \\n\\nDessert was a baklava walnut cake topped with honey ice cream.

We all had a great Time the service was great the food was great, Wife and I both had the Cesar Salad I added Chicken the wife did not.  I added a wing order plain with both sauces on the side,  another great choice! My son ordered the volcano fries I believe.  They were a little spicy for him but I had one and they were also very good.  \\n\\nExperience #1 \"4 Stars\"\\n\\nBreakfast the next Morning:  Being we had such a good experience the night before we decided we should try breakfast.  WOW did things change.  The only part of this experience that was favorable was the Hostesses!  They met you without delay and were extremely polite.  From Mount Everest to Death Valley from there.  We sat down and waited a while for our server \"Eric\" to arrive.  When he did he looked alike he had just gotten out of bed, and acted like we were wasting his time.  We ordered three things.  \\n\\n1.  Steak and Eggs which definitely missed their stop on Flavor Town, Extremely Bland!  Cooked well but again very bland.  \\n\\n2.  Chilaquiles.  Looked like it sat under a heat lamp too long and again other that the carne Asada which did taste ok we were not a fan.\\n\\n3.  Chicken fried Bacon biscuits and Gravy.  The gravy was obviously prepared by someone different the the cook that prepared the Bacon which was just above Raw.  Remember the Gravy?  Outstanding, However that was the only part of the dish that was going to be eaten by my son.  This dish should be changed to just Biscuits and Gravy!  \\n\\nLet me make a note that if it was not for the hostess and the guy bringing by the coffee I would have given breakfast 0 stars. However I am giving breakfast 2 stars for the things that were good.  \\n\\nAlso if you read the reviews it is obvious that Guy and his staff have written this place off as a lost cause because I cannot even see where they have replied to any of the reviews they have received.  Good or Bad.\\n\\nExperience #2. 2 Stars.\\n\\nOver all we give Guys a very charitable 3 stars. \\n\\nLastly the Hash House must be where Guy eats when he is in town.  They waiter stated that he had been there for a while and that Guy doesn\\'t even stop buy when he is in town.  \\n\\nWe did try the Hash House A GO Go and it was great.

       "  'text': \"POP was just what I needed on the first 3 digit day in Vegas yesterday! Situated in the corner of a large strip mall on Fort Apache, I was across the street for a lash appointment and decided to make a pit stop at Hobby Lobby. Felt parched and walked into Pop thinking it was a bubble tea joint, nope definitely not that - as the name implies it's pop for my midwesterners. Not just any old pop, speciality drinks made with pop. \\n\\nSuch a simple concept honestly, but very well thought out and executed. I'm not much of a pop drinker, after all I counsel against it. But every once in a while I'll give myself the option, luckily it's not something I crave. Initially it was the feeling that I had walked into the place assuming it was something else but felt odd walking out. I got to looking at the menu and looking back outside at the sun beaming down and thought I'd give it a whirl. Have to say, I will be back!\\n\\nSoda is used as a base ingredient to craft a drink. So if you create your own you choose a size, pick your soda (or tea for my healthies), pick your add ins. I appreciate that they have an XS size which for me was truly a S. Great for portion control people! Then they have a menu with fool proof recipes created for us. I chose the Jojo because I enjoy Dr. Pepper and substituted the coconut cream for vanilla cream. Yum! They also have a secret menu (see picture - white) of drink creations and needless to say I was overwhelmed with options. Finally, they have a foods fo pair alongside your beverages, popcorn and cookies. A kids menu per say - an XXS drink (12 oz) with kid size popcorn. Also, got beverages, coffee/hot chocolate. \\n\\nAside from my beverage being delicious, I appreciated the service. It's a very simple concept so to speak, so the fact that the employee took his time to talk me through the menu was above and beyond. The pricing was right! The shop has ample seating, parking. You get a stamp card for return visits. I wasn't told explicitly about a guarantee but I'm sure my drink would've been remade had I not liked it. \\n\\nI was told they have another location, Silverado Ranch. Will most definitely be going back and recommending on a hot, hot day!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'We visited last week.  Be Warned! My husband\\'s sister ordered a cheeseburger.  The waiter asked how she wanted it cooked and explained that \"Medium\" would be pink through-out.  She ordered the burger medium.  It took a very long time for our food to arrive and when it did, her burger was cooked very well done.  The waiter offered to have another burger made.  We had waited quite a while, and everyone was nearly done with their meals, all of us sharing with my sister-in-law whom still had no burger.  The waiter came by and my sister-in-law said to just cancel the order because we had already waited too long for it.  He said that he would take care of it.  A few minutes later, someone who appeared to be a manager came to the table delivering the burger we had already asked to be removed from the order.  My sister in law, frustrated at this point stated \"No, I don\\'t want it now\".  The manager walked away.  A few minutes later I noticed the manager with a waiter standing in the middle of the restaurant pointing at our table and mocking my sister-in-law like a school yard bully.  I very discreetly informed our waiter that I thought it was highly inappropriate for his manager to behave in such a way.  Moments later the manager stormed up to our table and began raising his voice at me and scolding me for my \"perception\" about what had taken place.  He then went on to blame the whole incident on the waiter, who had done nothing wrong.  I won\\'t be back.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Britney is one of the few stars that has ever existed that can command an entire arena, that emits spiritual and psychic positive energy through her voice and performance that has the power to change how an audience feels.  I have seen this countless times, at nightclubs: boring after boring song comes on, but when the DJ plays Britney suddenly the room erupts.  Very few performers had the ability to do this, in history.  Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland... the names on this list are surprisingly few.  However, Britney Spears is one of them.  She has the power to illuminate a room, and the World, with her work.  I am not quite sure she realizes this, she is probably far too humble, which is an integral part of  her mysterious Greatness... but I digress.\\n\\nI did not feel the staff at the Axis theater were worthy of her.  They were rude, rushed me into my seat and out of the theater just as soon as they could, and I barely had time to buy a tee- shirt.  I snuck next to the glass display to take a picture next to the \"oops\" outfit, and they practically yelled at me.  More so than anything they actually did, their demeanor was extremely GRUFF.  I can\\'t think of a better way to put it.  Nothing exactly happened... no one slapped me in the face or kicked me in the arse... but their words were short, rude, aggravated, impatient, and unsympathetic to a fan that had traveled 5 hours that very day (from Los Angeles) to see his idol.\\n\\nI am a huge fan of Elvis as well, so we stayed at the previous Hilton where he\\'d performed and had a fine time touring Elvis\\' old dressing room. We went to 1 Oak, had a Crab Buffet, and had a mini shopping spree at the Forum Shops. But of all the fun things we did AFTER, I could not shake in the back of my mind the negative cloud of what I\\'d experienced at the place that drew us to Vegas to begin with.  These people need to realize how much being in that theater means to some people... it is almost a spiritual experience.  When Britney levitated from the tree during Toxic, I almost felt my soul levitate, too! \\n\\nShame on them, for poisoning such a momentous experience.  As usual, ignorant peons in the world will spoil Greatness.  But there is enough negativity in the world, a point I think Spears herself combats with her positive soul and music.  There need not be any negativity in the arena of a performer who does so much to expunge the world\\'s ugliness, and there need not be unhappiness spread in the very Pantheon where Spears herself is employed to make us happy.  She was born to make us happy, that is her soul\\'s purpose... so let her do so without the grumblings of those who can only think of what they are going to have for dinner after their shift is over. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nNicholas Kafantaris',\n",

But in the past year, Allegiant has failed miserably in delivering on time performance, bags, customer service , and cancellations.  Allegiant is not a large enough airline to be required to provide on time performance data, but on my last two trips to the Vegas airport, the information boards only showed ONE Allegiant flight that was not delayed on departure.   Not weather, not ATC, but all mechanical issues.  \\n\\nIf you are willing to risk delays or cancellation,and view an airline trip as a rapid long distance bus ride on aircraft that are not up today's standards for technology, Allegiant is an option.   If you value on time performance, and expect some measure of good customer service, choose a different airline.\",\n",

Usually brown rice can be in general grainier than white rice. However, I never really notice that at chipotle which is a plus. The chicken can be a bit charred or dry sometimes but it's normally not a problem. I also get the fajita veggies. However, the veggies can be a hit or miss for me. I normally like my veggies more the in the saut√©ed side but sometimes they can be more crunchy and raw for my taste. I love their corn salsa so I tell the person to like that stuff on my bowl.

The owner has paid attention to interiors but if it is supposed to be depict fine dining, bar and lounge then they need to do something more than just hanging the chandelier from the top. It is not a nice view when you look up because I have never been to a fine dining and lounge space that has undone ceiling. Looks very cheap.\\n\\nService was good. Food could have been better. Their raspberry ginger mojito was very good. Their pan seared scallops which they claim is one of their signature dishes was overcooked. The presentation although was very good. Their zucchini fries were average with no salt. \\nTheir spicy seafood pasta which again they claim is one of their signature dishes was average. Pasta was overcooked.  They had some mussels and tiny shrimps for the sake of calling it seafood pasta. Restaurants like this should not cut corners in preparing food like this. We didn' t like their cheap cheese grater. I have better ones at home.\\nTheir creme brulee was a disaster. Looks like the chef made no efforts to serve it fresh. It had an overdose of vanilla essence. The caramelized sugar coating was cold, thick and extremely sweet. The caramelization part is supposed to be done just before serving.  Little did we know they serve it pre made. Very disappointing.  \\nWe have been to some of the best food places all over the country. So when it comes to restaurants we pay attention to many details. The place failed to sparkle for us last night.\",\n",

They recommended me to Dr. Daccache, who is great by the way. After that was completed and healed properly, I came back in to discuss my Invisalign treatment. Little did I know, I had some pretty bad cavities on my right top and bottom side(one almost turned into a root canal). And that's when I knew I had to switch to Bella Smiles. \\nI was led to believe from my previous dental practitioners that I had no cavities and was good to go.  \\n\\nThe staff at Bella Smiles are amazing at what they do, and I always feel welcomed whenever I walk in through the door. \\nI definitely trust them with my teeth to tell you the least!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I went to Streetcar Po-Boys fully intent on enjoying an authentic Louisiana po-boy.  The restaurant is in a sketchy area of town, literally right next door a strip club.  They\\'re located in a run down building, which still reeks of the days it spent as a Chinese restaurant.  Everything is in disrepair: there is a large piece of plywood in the middle of the front door, perhaps from a prior break-in?, the carpet is worn down to nothingness, the fluorescent lights are overwhelming, and blinding, which exposes and magnifies every fault of the restaurant.  There is nothing cohesive about the interior of this restaurant, and the senses are left confused and probably offended.\\nThe menu is decent, it is after all a sandwich shop.  The po-boys all sound enticing, with everything from crawfish and oysters, to turkey and gravy, and even a vegetarian option.  The sweet tea is authentic, and the servers are incredibly warm and welcoming, and after ordering, for a brief moment, you\\'re left feeling optimistic.\\nBut here again, the weird, decrepitness of the restaurant messes everything up.  You find yourself sitting in weird booths that seem to have come out of a 1950s diner, being served drinks in Caesar\\'s Palace cups, staring at open shelving that\\'s yellowed over time, and now contains a hodgepodge of low-quality bulk restaurant items.  Heat lamps are hung clumsily from yellow chains, low-quality, inkjet printed signs are posted everywhere, the kitchen doors seem to be bloated from water damage, and there\\'s a pervasive odour of old Chinese food mixed with mould.  It\\'s sad, and I was waiting to see Gordon Ramsey come screaming out of the kitchen, cursing everything.\\nThe food, was mediocre at best.  The fried pickles were super oily, the meat used on the sandwiches was the lowest, lowest, lowest quality.  I ordered the \"Ragin Cajun,\" which was to come with turkey, gravy and fries.  I thought it would come with shaved, fresh turkey slices, smothered in hot gravy, and loaded with fries.  Nope.  Two flimsy turkey slices, made from waaaay over processed \"meat,\" and about 5 french fries literally smashed atop the \"meat.\"  It was served warm-ish, with a stingy amount of fries on the side.  The meat was so gross, I couldn\\'t eat it.\\n\\nOverall, with even the slightest investment, this could be a great Las Vegas eatery, but it\\'s location, the building, and the low-quality ingredients make it so I\\'ll never go back, and I certainly won\\'t recommend it to anyone - and in the restaurant industry, that\\'s the kiss of death.',\n",

       "  'text': \"So I'm only giving this hotel an extra star because of the customer service I received from Alicia. I'm one that takes reviews into consideration but I also like to come up with my own. Arriving at the hotel it seemed nice. Slightly run down but nothing to bad. Upon entering the room was a different story. Immediately when we went into our room it smelled like sh*t literally. The ac unit on the wall only made it worse blowing out warm air. The carpet was dingy, the sunken tub was filthy and there were burn marks everywhere from the room to the restroom counter. Even though they advertise non smoking can't blame them for stupid people making breaking the rules. Within the first 5 minutes I honestly had to vomit from the smell and did. We immediately went back to the front desk and let Alicia know that we just couldn't stay. She was very apologetic and helpful and let me know that if I notified groupon for a refund she would honor it. So thank you Alicia for your customer service. If rumor can get the cleanliness in tact with the customer service that Alicia gave their profit and customer feedback can improve.\",\n",

I found out about the Dollhouse through a friend of mine, who highly suggested we try it out.  I am so glad we did!  They wash and condition your hair, massage your scalp, and put a fragrance of your choice into your hair.  I chose spearmint, which smelled heavenly!  Then, they give you a glass of water and champagne with a sweet treat in it.  I normally don't like champagne, but this glass was amazing.  Then they ask what kind of style you are looking to get, then work their magic.  My fine flat hair looked supermodel gorgeous when they were done!!!  My friends and I had such a fun time here, and I suggest this place to anyone looking for a girly thing to do with their friends.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I went to Paul Mitchell The School after I saw a $19 Groupon for $30 towards a service.  I called at 9:30am to make an ombre hair color appointment with a Phase 2 student.  The receptionist was able to book me a 1:30pm appointment that same day with Jaymee.  Even though Jaymee is a student, she really knew what she was doing.  She was teaching a newer student (Rachel) about the techniques for ombre.  It made me feel very relieved when Jaymee was explaining each step of what she was doing.  Because I have very long, dark, and thick hair, I knew the appointment was going to take a while.  After starting at 1:30pm, I was out by 5pm.  This is understandable due to my hair and because students need to review their actions with their instructors.  Keep this in mind if you are thinking of coming here.  I feel 100% satisfied with my hair color service by Jaymee.  I also enjoyed the complimentary hand and arm massage I received from Rachel.  Overall I give the service I received 5 stars!  My ombre dye job cost $50, after I saved $11 from buying the Groupon.  What a great deal!  My suggestion would be to request a Phase 2 student (especially Jaymee!) if you are planning to get a color service.  It is well worth the extra ~$10.  Another great thing I found out is that men haircuts are $5 on Tuesdays.  You won't regret it if you come to the Paul Mitchell School.  If you're hesitant, please remember that all students will be supervised by a licensed professional.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Made my online reservation with Hertz as part of my airline discount package in order to rent a car for the weekend of Electric Daisy Carnival 2011. Everything within an hour Vegas was BOOKED solid, and I mean solid. I was able to find one of the lodges 2 hours out of town that had space, so I was set. \\n\\n***Here is the important part of the entire review: I got a discount because it was PREPAID.\\n\\nI got off of work, made it to the airport on time, checked in early, everything a-ok, even had my print out of my reservation and info to pick up my car rental at 10pm on Friday. I go to the ticket counter, and the staff is taking their time. Fine, I can still make it to the lodge on time and check in. This is also important, because the front desk is not open 24 hours. After midnight your screwed. The receptionist was willing to wait up til 1am for me to check in, though. But no later, as this place is so small no one else is at the desk until 5am. With only a few people in line in front of me, I should be ok.\\n\\nNope. Staff is so incompetent and computer system is so archaic that 30 minutes passes before the NEXT person is served. The manager tries to get people to use the Hertz electronic kiosk, as she can tell we are all frustrated with how SLOW the service is. I'm a savvy travel and think this should not be a problem and take the kiosk route with a few others. But the couple in front of me have issues with their reservation, and flag down the manager to help them (she is VERY pregnant and can't deal with the stress of 10 minutes of nothing working).\\n\\nMy turn at the kiosk. I try several different methods to get my reservation. Scan my print out. Type in my reservation number. Put in my credit card info again. 15 minutes of attempts, and nothing. By now I would've been in the front of the line. Finally the kiosk recognizes me, and tells me to SEE AN ATTENDANT about my issue. I get back in line and wait another 10 minutes before anyone can help me (thank God they didn't put me in the BACK of the line again). \\n\\nAt this point I WASTE another 10 minutes as the reservations agent at the terminal can't get my reservation to go through, despite the print out and online info on my phone. THEY ARE SURE WILLING TO TAKE YOUR MONEY, BUT NOT GIVE YOU THE CAR. They cannot take the credit card I provided. YET THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE MONEY. \\nWhen I showed them that I had been charged already (yes, I brought out my bank transactions, this has happened before and this usually works) they STILL WOULD NOT RENT ME THE CAR I HAD ALREADY PAID FOR. \\n\\nNow the manager gets involved, as she can sense my frustration with the staff to a perfectly simple and logical transaction. And what can she do about it? Nothing. Not willing to get on the phone and talk to Hertz, or to over ride. Is this for REAL? A rental service that operates 24 hours a day and you can't get anyone on the phone to fix this issue? And she wasn't going to try? EVEN THOUGH THE RESERVATION FOR THE RENTAL WAS PREPAID AND YOU TOOK MY MONEY?!\\n\\nBy now in my anger I had missed the call that the receptionist at the lodge was checking in with me. Whatever TIME I had buffered to make it to the extended deadline to check in at the lodge was now SLIPPING AWAY. Knowing that my frustration was mounting, I walked away and waited in line at another car rental agency and got a car. \\n\\nThat's right. Walked up, waited in line 5 minutes, talked to an agent from a competitor and got them to MATCH MY CAR TYPE AND DISCOUNT with HERTZ and get the paperwork car within 10 minutes TOTAL. I went back to the HERTZ desk and asked to make sure I was getting a REFUND FOR A CAR RENTAL THAT WAS PREPAID THAT I WAS  *NOT* GETTING. \\n\\nGuess what the manager said?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nAt this point I cussed out the agent that initially helped me and the manager because they know NOTHING about customer service. You can't release the cat to the same credit card you were MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE PREPAID MONEY FROM, and WON'T REFUND THE MONEY when you can't give me the car. No print out that says I was NOT given my car when I call Hertz billing come Monday. \\n\\nBy now it's 11:30pm Friday night when I drive off in a non-HERTZ car, and I have to fly like a bat out of hell to make the deadline at the lodge. I would have to deal with Hertz later, as I had wasted enough time with them.\\n\\nI've rambled enough, but in short guess who SLEPT IN THE CAR in the parking lot of the lodge? Surely it wasn't a HERTZ car that I slept in, no sir-ree -bob! \\n\\nIn summary, even with all the paperwork, print outs, online info and correct identification info on my person, HERTZ would not rent me my prepaid car, nor would they refund it. Due to the length of incompetent  time and poor service I received at Hertz, I did not make my reservation on time at my lodging. \\n\\nAVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.\\n\\np.s. Guess who is on hold with Hertz billing as I write this?\",\n",

Definitely not a bad deal at all.    The buffet is ok, but really  nothing to write home about.     We got there right as breakfast was ending, so I won't blame them for running out of several things.    Breakfast selection looked pretty standard (breakfast meats, pastries, omlet station, etc).   There were also a few entrees and some desserts out, but I'm not sure if those were already being put out for lunch, or if they had them out during breakfast as well.   The blueberry pancake was amazing (not standard individual pancakes, more of a bluberry pancake batter baked into a dish and scooped out with a spoon).    Lunch was decent...there was nothing in particular that stood out, although the desserts were pretty good (loved the chocolate tart).    Similarly, dinner was reasonably good but there was nothing that was particularly amazing or stood out.  The roast beef at the carving station was probably my favorite.   Many of the same entrees and desserts were repated at lunch and dinner, which is probably to be expected but was a bit of a bummer, since we were hoping for a little more variety.\",\n",

She then said she would replace the pizza ONLY IF NONE OF THE SLICES WERE TOUCHED & IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER HOUR (putting us past 7 pm, when we ordered before 5 pm) After explaining our situation, she spoke with the manager and came back to say she could offer a $2 credit off our next order. \\n\\nI said that was unacceptable. I spent over $120 with their business in the past week. She said the manager would call me back... I NEVER RECEIVED A CALL.\\n\\nNEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY NO LONGER RECEIVE OUR BUSINESS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN $500/MO EASILY.\",\n",

My mother and I took Allegiant to Las Vegas from Colorado Springs and we weren\\'t expecting much after reading all of the other reviews. My disabled mother was not able to get her carry on into the overhead bins and asked a flight attendant for help. The flight attendant\\'s response was to \"do it yourself\". Flight attendants are supposed to help those in need! Our flight was late leaving the gate, seats would not recline on the MD-80, they did an inflight beverage service but charged for every damn thing you would normally get for free such as orange juice and water. There wasn\\'t any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant. I might do a budget airline again but never Allegiant, they are so disorganized and rude. They don\\'t know what good customer service is, and I am warning everyone I know about them!',\n",

I'm so glad I finally tried this place! love LOVE their burgers and fries. \\n\\nSo, it's looks are deceiving. It looks closed due to the lack of customers whenever I pass by. But they are open! We visit this place about once a month, as a treat. The staff is always super nice and chill. The burgers are always cooked to perfection and put together neatly with the fixins! I usually order the small fat with skinny fries. I have tried the onion rings, and they were delicious, but it started to be too much to eat after I finish a delicious fatburger. \\n\\nI learned that this chain is in each Station casino, minus Boulder Station. I haven't visited those locations. I'm really glad this location isn't too far from our apt. :) They have a frequent visitor card thing. You get a stamp for each fatburger you purchase, and it's double stamps on Tuesdays. Fill up a card and you get a free Fatburger! I haven't read the fine print, but I'm saving our full cards for a lazy day :)\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Wow, guess my review was a bit premature.  I\\'m now going thru a similar experience with James G.\\'s review of 3/1/18.  I believe his story is spot on since encountering my own grief with the billing dept. of this office.  I spoke with Michael too, at exit of my last cleaning using their 12 month $299 plan, on 2/28/18.  He gave me options going forward for the 2 plans they offer and he said \"NO NEED to choose one now since I don\\'t have a cleaning scheduled till 5/31/18.\"  He said \"the plan is 12 mos so you\\'ll waste 3 mos of that waiting till 5/31/18.\"  I knew this already and was not going to choose either plan that day.  He made NO mention of needing to sign a letter rejecting an automatic renewal of that plan [which I was totally unaware of] by the next day 3/1/18.  Lo and behold, when paying my Capital One card Sunday 3/11/18 I see Cherrington Dental charged me $299 on that very next day, 3/1/18, without my consent.  Not only that, they DID NOT send me a receipt for that $299, so I had no idea it was done.  Had I not gone over my charges as usual I would have missed it.  Pretty low down sneaky and rotten thing to do to a patient of 1 year!  Where was the question, do you want to renew for another year, or change plans?  Or, will you have insurance this year??  Questions never asked.  \\n\\nThis is supposed to be a dental practice helping/caring for patients.  So, I called the Dental office and was told by Angie that Michael & Tammy were busy, that no charge reversal would be done, and that I would receive a return call that afternoon - 3/13/18.  Of course, no call came 3/13 or 3/14, so today 3/15/18 I called Capital One to start a dispute to reverse this nonsense.\\n\\nNow we\\'ve had 4 days of grief in our house due to this, and I\\'m out a perfectly fine hygienist with a need to find another Dental office.\\n\\nTo anyone reading I would, and now have to, look elsewhere for a Dental office that earns my trust.',\n",

They have a menu outside their front doors and I observed it.  Well, I saw that they have Pho!!! I loooove Pho and it is difficult to find in my hometown area.  So right away, I knew I already wanted to come back and try it.  When I got back to my hotel, I read a few Yelp reviews and saw pictures from my fellow Yeeps Ken L and Mike O. \\n\\nI came back next day, before opening 11am Monday morning.  I got there 15 minutes early and a line was already forming!  I think I was the 4th person and by the time they opened, I am sure there were at least 30 people waiting.  I got the impression that this was a great sign and people in line were ready to get in and order lunch!!  The restaurant is very open area, lots of space, and nice decor.  I liked it very much and felt comfortable seated at my table.  There are lots of tables and I also saw a counter area. \\n\\nMy server came over and took my order.  I still looked over the menu while I was waiting and there are soooo many items on there that I would love to try, but I specifically came back for the \"Pho Prime\".  OK, this is the most Expensive Pho I have ever bought at $16.95.  I normally pay 7-8$ for a bowl at other places in Nor Cal.  But that being said, I really didn\\'t care about the price, if I want something, I buy it and plus I was on vacation in Vegas... have to Enjoy every moment to the fullest :)\\n\\nThe Pho Prime was Delicious.  It had a great flavor in the broth, lots of meats, lots of noodles, and I enjoyed eating it  BUT, No Hoisin sauce, it didn\\'t come with my plate so I asked for it and my server said they ran out yesterday??  The Pho Prime is a huge bowl too, I could not finish it.  It was definitely worth the price and place!  My server was OK, and she was busy with other tables as well.  I was disappointed I couldn\\'t order a dessert, 3 of 4 choices that I wanted to try on the menu were out!!!  At first I almost didn\\'t believe it lol, like for real?  I really wanted to order the Hawaiian Papaya :/  so I decided not to get a dessert, changed my mind.  Then it took awhile for me to get the bill, I was waiting...\\n\\nOverall, I had a very good lunch and Yes, I would definitely return!  Considering the location, how much I like the Venetian casino, and all the menu options that I read sounded tasty.  Hopefully, the next time I am in town I can come in and order a big dinner.  This is a great place for couples or groups, plenty of seating.  I left fulfilled and satisfied that I got my Pho ;)',\n",

I took my wife to N9NE at the tail end of May.\\n\\nI was ill-prepared to be well-dressed as it was vacation, but not only did they seat us with courtesy but had no problems getting us in on last-minute reservations.  Stewart, our table assistant, was excellent in handling explanations and service for my wife and I.  \\n\\nThe food lived up to billing - from beginning to end, from salads to steaks to desserts.  The meat was prepared to spec, and required no additional seasoning or additives - nor was it over-prepared or over-salted.  \\n\\nAt the end of the night, the bill was more reasonable than I expected.  All staff was courteous and friendly from the time we entered the facility to our departure.  N9NE is on my planned stopping point in January when I go back for a conference.\\n\\nAnd I'll ask for Stewart.\",\n",

I'm sure the chef cooks them well, but those two dishes should never cost that much unless you have enough to feed an army.

       "  'text': 'Whatever you do, stay away from any free deal these people offer for you to sit through their timeshare presentation!!! On the paperwork it says the presentation lasts for 2-2 and a half hrs. Well when we showed up, our salesman told us we would be with him for the next 3 hrs. He was so nice at first, got along with my friend and I, laughed a lot and then when we asked how much the timeshare was, he wouldn\\'t answer and kept changing the subject. He took us outside to show us the \"beautiful view\" which was dead desert. Not too beautiful to me. He walked us to the common room where people hangout and watch tv, everyone had to be 75 yrs and older, I am 30. It seemed more like a retirement home than a timeshare. I noticed it had been over two hrs and thanked him for his time but we weren\\'t interested. He said we were not allowed to leave until the 3 hrs was up. I told him I signed a paper which said I only had to stay for two to two and a half hrs. He said if we left we would not receive the free things we were promised. So at this point we have literally been blackmailed and kidnapped since what I signed said I could leave after two hrs.  I figured we could tough it out since it would only be another 45 minutes. That 45 minutes felt longer than the first 2 hrs. These guys don\\'t know the word no, they do not listen to you and they turn into assholes after they know you won\\'t buy from them. I said no about 30 times and the manager walks up, tells us a guy is selling his timeshare and I can get it for the price of $12,000. Half price of what the timeshare was (which was a complete lie) I said no. He then lowered it to $4,000. Again, I said no. He then offered me the timeshare for free and all I had to do was pay the $1,000 taxes each year and put down $1400 today and my week stays would be the $209 a week. I swear if I had to hear them say \" and for ONLY $209 a week you can stay ANYWHERE in the world\" one more time, I was going to scream. They made my friend cry out of frustration of not allowing us to leave  at the 3 hr mark and they kept pressuring us and wouldn\\'t sign the paper saying we finished the presentation. It was like they wanted to make us so mad I would just sign up so they would shut up. When you don\\'t listen to a girl when she says no, hold her against her will and make her cry and say sexual remarks about her body the entire time it\\'s a close feeling to being sexually abused.....not okay.....At 3 hrs and 20 minutes we were finally told we could leave.....finally free. We were sent to another room to tell a man how our presentation went. As my friend was still crying we told him how awful it was. He had to fill out a questionnaire on our answers and the question on the page said \"how was the presentation\" after we told him how awful they were to us I saw him write \"good\" on the answer line.....he straight up lied on their questionnaire! I then was sent to another man to get my 4 free nights at the Luxor and my $200 deposit back. He said it would take two days to be put back into my account. It took over a week. When we got on the bus, everyone had similar stories. I was the only one who was dumb enough to put a $200 deposit down. So if you do want to visit Hell on earth for free stuff, you do NOT have to put the deposit down! Don\\'t do it. We all agreed it was not worth the free stuff they promise.',\n",

This is one of my favorite restaurants but I had a bad experience here today- I have a severe allergy to onions and the waiter took the order correctly but the chef decided to cook my food with onions and what looks like tried to pick them out but they were still there. Long story short my throat started closing and I found a few of the onions in my beef hor fun. I requested for the manager to come so I could address the issue- was that a mistake. She looked at me like I was in the wrong and the waiter even said the kitchen made a mistake.

We showed up an hour before close (so sorry we were running late), like many restaurants do I was fearful we would be rushed out the door and a turn and burn table. Instead, we had top knotch service. We were greeted by the friendly Manager Javier & our server Kobee. They were kind and informative and it was obvious that they were going to make sure it was a memorable experience for us.\\n\\nWe ordered many appetizers (do yourself a favor and get the zucchini flowers), a bottle of wine (Kobee recommended the lovely and tasty antinori peppoli), full entrees and everything from presentation to the obvious team work culture, to the TASTE of everything we had we were blown away and it was so lovely.  On top of all of that, they sent out a sample of a dessert liquor and dessert, a sample appetizer, and some champagne on the house. I kid you not- we asked for an experience and they gave us one. I was so thankful and it made the evening with two long distance friends catching up, the most pleasurable time imaginable and we thank Javier & Kobee for this!!

I came specifically because my co workers told me how great the Patron Milkshakes are and that the food was tasty! \\n\\nWell first blow to my experience was that they were out of Patron milkshakes! Can someone explain to me how a restaurant that is located on the strip of Las Vegas on a Saturday afternoon is out of anything?!! I was livid. They told me that they were out of the milkshake mix but not the Patron. Sounds like bad managing of inventory if you ask me. \\n\\nSecondly the customer service was horrible. They did not offer a replacement drink for my troubles and our waitress was switched out without warning and the first waitress gave us the wrong information. She allowed my friends to order $19 bottomless mimosas and then after serving the mimosas told them that the deal would end in about 10 minutes!! Wth!! Basically meaning that in 10 minutes they had to drink as many as they could. That's horrible. \\n\\nThe waitress ended up taking it off of the bill but here is where it gets worse. \\n\\nThe mimosas were watered down like they had been pre-made and were sitting in a pitcher of ice all day. They must do better than that. The food was disgusting. The English muffin on my eggs Benedict was stale and hard. The hollandaise sauce lacked flavor and my food was cold. I'm just so fed up with place. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Maybe try Shake Shack next door. Come to think of it. I should've just gone next door ordered a shake from shake shack and told them to put Patron in it. But I was so pissed off and in complete disbelief at the service and experience I couldn't think logically. This place has got to get it together.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I have been here twice.  The first time they had a tough time because there was a group of eight people who got there before us, and there was so little wait staff that everything took a very long time.  Just eight people!  Anyway, I had the seafood pho.  The broth was very good, and I would say it was on a par with Saigon 8, which is one of the best.  The bowl of pho was interesting in a good way.  The fish pieces were actual good sized pieces of fish, not fish balls.  There were even baby octopus.\\n\\nI was there a second time about a week later.  Service was faster.  However, there was a bit of a screw up by the waitress.  We got two bowls, and they weren't meant for our table.  I'd have eaten it anyway, and even put in sprouts, sauces, and so on.  I suppose I'd forgotten just what I'd ordered.  Then it was taken away.  My pho was pretty good, and by the way, I never saw that waitress again.\\n\\nBy comparison with other Viet Pho restaurants, there are differences.  They use lacquered chop sticks, rather than throw-away wooden ones as used by Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon.  The lacquered ones look classy, but are harder to use.  Tougher to hold onto the noodles.  Unlike other places, they bring the spoons and small empty dishes later, along with the meal.  My problem with that is that I cannot mix my dipping sauce while waiting for the rest of the stuff.  Also, they don't immediately bring out sprouts and greens and sliced peppers, which come out just before the pho.  I like using the sprouts to dip into the dipping bowl, kind of like you would do in a Mexican restaurant.  I know, it's just a whim of mine, but that's what I like to do.  Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon make it easy for me to do.\",\n",

Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.\\n\\nOn to the sandwiches and burgers:\\n\\n\"Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that\\'s a good boy.  Now shake hands.  Awww Rod\\'s a good doggie\".\\n\\nContrary to what my ex might say, I\\'m not a dog.  I don\\'t expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.\\n\\nA \"big dipper\" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  Impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The \"off-da-hook smash burger\" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the \"mac-n-cheese bacon burger\"  Cloying, greasy, way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.\\n\\nProps for service.  Fast and attentive.  \\n\\nGreat for the Vegas tourist looking for the show.  Locals and regulars look elsewhere.',\n",

Within those 7 days my wife brought me over 100 dollars in magazines and books to read which the staff lost and wouldn't return her calls to get the refund. Now it's been over a month and not one of the 16 phone calls and 8 emails were returned. Then I started the outpatient program that I wasted 30 days of my life at for Clai the therapist to say She can't treat PTSD and that I just need to get my shit together. Oh and FYI this was after she told me she has a good bullshit meter and that they knew of the suicidal thoughts I had the night before. How she has a job I will never know!! Hope if you are having issues like I have then you will not go there. You may if your lucky get 25mins with a doctor a week. Clai was completely unprofessional and no way should be employed as a therapist. I am active duty military and there are a few others in that program if you can't help ptsd, depression, or suicidal thoughts then you need to resign before you make someone kill themselves. She is going to get someone hurt or worse. If this is how they treat military than by all means brothers and sisters stay away!!!!! Luckily I have a wonderful wife to help who is helping me find the help I need.           \\nUPDATE**** I will never contact this dick face that commented. You guys could give two shits about military and Clai is going to get someone killed.\",\n",

Finally the hostess came over and I asked again to speak to the manager. The manager finally came over to our table and asked \"can I help you?\". I started explaining the situation and he cut me off before I could get one sentence out and asked what we were ordering. He was uninterested in our concern, did not apologize, and made some lame excuse like the hostess shouldn\\'t have brought us there.

We stayed in 2 connecting suites that were very spacious and gave us enough room to be comfortable. The entire hotel is massive and is almost like a big mall. There's a ton of restaurants that serve all different kinds of food that everyone can find something to eat. The Venetian is placed in a good spot on the Strip where we were able to walk to other hotels and see a lot of different areas. The look inside the hotel is gorgeous to the point that there are places inside the hotel that you actually feel like you're in Italy. I've been to Italy and there are some places in the hotel where I actually caught myself thinking I was back in Italy. If there was one negative it's that to get around the hotel or to get from your hotel room to outside the hotel it's a pretty big walk which I expected, but still after a long day of walking around to have to get to the hotel only to realize you have to walk a while longer to get back to your room was a bit of an annoyance. Nevertheless, my family had a blast and we loved the hotel and when we go back to Vegas we will probably be staying in the Venetian again.\",\n",

There were booths set up everywhere and longboards, snowboards, stickers, and posters of all kinds of extreme sports tacked down.  The menu gives you a lot of options. You can have chicken, fish or tofu burritos, tacos, or all kinds of plates.  Jonathon at the register was extremely friendly and recommended the enchiladas. You basically order once you come in, they give you a number and then you sit and watch the awesome projector showing extreme sports clips of guys eating it and doing gnarly tricks. Apart from the restaurant is the bar, which is in a separate room that you can see through the huge glass window from the restaurant. What I love the most about this place is it is opened 24/7 with food and drinks.  Oh yeah!  \\n\\nAs for the food, my enchilada was tasty and my shrimp tacos was ehh.

       "  'text': \"My friend and I ate here for dinner after our full day on the Strip having fun. We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, since there was almost a full house that night. The lighting and ambiance was very nice and casual, and their seats were very comfortable too. We ordered drinks, as well as some of their popular dishes: Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits. For a starter, we ordered the waiter's recommendation of their crab cakes.\\n\\nThe crab cakes were super fresh and delicious. We popped them into our mouths and had to discipline ourselves to enjoy them to the fullest because the plate only had four of them. The cakes were paired with fresh greens and a tasty sauce, making a plate full of different textures. The food was savory, salty, sweet, and each taste didn't clash with one another. Just a warning though, like I said, the dish only contained four of them, so if you eat them up too quickly, you may end up regretting it!\\n\\nThe Shrimp and Grits dish was actually the first time I've ever tried grits before, and because of this, I now have high expectations for grits! Hahaha! Again, I have to say that this dish was also savory too (I love savory food). If only I could order more grits because those grits were just very fluffy and delicious! The shrimp was good too and both complimented each other very nicely. I would definitely come back to this place and order this dish again and again!\\n\\nMy friend ordered their most popular dish, Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles (I think that's how it's sequentially ordered...either way, you'll know what I'm talking about once you take a look at the menu yourself!). I especially LOVED this dish because it was their own twist on chicken and waffles. It's been almost two weeks, since eating there, so all I can remember is that it was one of the best chicken and waffles combination I've ever had. Their fried chicken was very crispy (I would have tried to request crispier skin, but I was already too hungry to wait for them to edit the dish), the waffles were sweet (even sweeter when doused in their maple syrup), and the watermelon was juicy! I do wish, however, that the dish had the full plate of waffles, instead of only using half of what was made in a waffle maker. For that price (around $33), they could have definitely added one more fried chicken and the other half of the waffles from the waffle maker. I'd get this dish again too!\",\n",

I'm referring to the overcooked cuts of meat, crappy dessert selection, cold food (when it should have been hot) and most of all, the lack of labeling the food stations (which pissed me off the most). It was aggravating to have to go to the front of the lines just to see what the food was or to view the itty-bitty food description signage.\\n\\nI will say, good selection of shrimp.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"4.5 stars!\\n\\nA new-age southern style restaurant in the heart of Venetian.   Quite a few exemplary choices here, just with the strip prices you'd come to expect.\\n\\nLet's start with one of the best Fried Chicken dishes you may encounter :\\n\\nChicken n' Watermelon n' Waffles ($36): Honey Hot Sauce, Chilled Spiced Watermelon, Cheddar Cheese Chow Chow Waffle & Bourbon Maple Syrup. The most tender and juicy fried chicken I've had to date, the waffles crisp and flavorful. I prefer my fried chicken to be full of spice, but this was an excellent rendition!  A bit spendy, but worth the go ahead with the large sharing portion.\\n\\nMama's Chicken Biscuits ($14): Free Range Fried Chicken, Pepper Jelly, House Pickles & Buttermilk Biscuit. Incredibly fluffy, buttery sweet biscuit with lightly battered chicken, moist and flavorful. Recommended!  I could eat these biscuits for days :D\\n\\nLow & Slow Smoked Chicken Salad ($16): Haas Avocado, Warm Cornbread & Yogurt Dressing. Loved the cornbread texture and flavor, the chicken full of flavor and pairing perfectly with the yogurt dressing. Wonderful! \\n\\nFried Green Tomato 'BLT' ($14): Pork Belly, Greens, Tomato Jam & Pimento Cheese. Succulent pork belly, fat rendered and buttery, with a nice crunchy cornbread and pimento pulling it together. \\n\\nFried Bread & Butter Pickle Spears ($6): Spicy Salt & Spiked Dukes Mayo. Light breading, similar to Fish & Chips consistency. Dipping mayo very enjoyable!\\n\\nDeviled Eggs ($11): Fresh Dill & Smoked Trout Roe. Well balanced and fresh, the roe adding just a hint of salt to finish\\n\\nChicken Liver Toast ($5): Grilled Country Bread, Cuke & Fresno Pepper Relish. Mildly mineral in flavor, the acid in the relish complimented well. \\n\\nFlorida Heirloom Tomatoes ($16): Toasted Peanut Hummus, Basil, Smoked Tomato Sorbet, Field Shoots, Crunchy Puffed Ca. Dressing was very enjoyable with a nice addition of peanut hummus \\n\\nMacaroni & Cheese ($10): Torchio Pasta, Five Artisanal Cheeses & Crispy Herb Crust. Well rendered, just missing some spice to set it off from the cheese.\\n\\nCountry Pork Terrine ($10): Pickled Cauliflower, Grilled Country Bread & Whole Grain Mustard. Very heavy and lunch-meat like terrine, it paired well with the mustard. \\n\\nAnd for dessert :\\n\\nKey Lime Donut Bites: Coconut Pudding & Mango Jellies. Interesting combination with the citrus, I enjoyed the pudding / mango jelly, light and delicate.\\n\\nCrunch & Munch Bread Pudding: M&Ms Bread Pudding, Popcorn Ice Cream & Candied Pretzel. Incredibly sweet, the bread pudding was thick and rich, almost brownie-like.  A bit too sweet for my tastes, but one can figure that out reading the ingredients.\\n\\nBacon Butterscotch Cake: Pecan Pie Filling & Bourbon Ice Cream. Delicious cake, fair bacon flavor throughout, with a very crispy bacon piece for garnish. Good! \\n\\n\\n\\nStick with the fried chicken, biscuits and cornbread concoctions, and you will fare well!  \\n\\nEat up :)\",\n",

The wait staff was attentive. Above average ambiance. The experience soon deteriorated when the food started to arrive. The standard relish tray and bread (what imagination). Escargot served with a soggy pastry topping (truly uninspiring). Rack of lamb for two $175 served on two platters each with a huge stuffed tomato Two \"big chunks\" of cauliflower and broccoli together with a bowl of vegetables (\"me hungry\"). A feast fit for a lumberjack, but not fine dining. Quantity must equal quality at Michaels.I ordered a side of creamed spinach that was milky and slimy (the only word I can use to describe it). To finish, some chocolate covered fruit accompanied by a big  a bowl of fruit. I\\'m full once again just remembering. This review is harsh but accurate. I love the South Point but Michaels  need not worry about another bad review from me.',\n",

I dined alone which is always kind of awkward at first, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself here. I wasn't in the mood to sit in a restaurant in the middle of everything....this restaurant is kind of off to the side and it was much quieter and had a nice, relaxing atmosphere. I seriously could not decide what to order! I wanted to try so many things...the crab cakes, the clams with white wine, dijon, and garlic bread, the albacore sashimi with white truffle ponzu, the lobster mac and cheese (although my server was informed they were out while I was giving her my order so that solved my problem), or the crab gumbo served over rice. I wasn't super hungry so I went with the clams (my server suggested I get that) and a wedge salad.  They also give you these mini biscuits and corn bread muffins beforehand. Overall it was a great experience if you are in a relaxing mood and want a good glass of wine and great seafood.\",\n",

About 3 hours later, Tony said that the car was almost finished and that all the pumps were in good condition, and only the belts and pulley needed to be replaced.  He took the car for an extended drive to check everything out before I tried to make it back home to SoCal.

And boy were we tipsy.\\n\\nMy favorite dish was probably the shrimp and grits! Again, if you haven't noticed a trend in my reviews.. I LOVE SEAFOOD so anything with it, I will love it.

Good selection of channels available on the TV, and the kitchen had a stove, oven, microwave, and stuff to cook with, which was lovely.\\n\\nThere is good security at the door - the guard asks where you're heading to or who you're visiting at the gate which keeps out random wanderers. Nice bar across the street too if you want some quick and affordable food.\\n\\nYou're basically in the middle of nowhere, but though I have not personally tried it, I hear there's a shuttle that takes you from the resort to the Strip.\\n\\nHOWEVER, the BIGGEST downside (in my opinion anyway) is no free wi-fi - you have to pay quite a bit extra for it. When you consider how even really crappy hotels have free wi-fi, it was ridiculous and annoying that a nice place like this didn't offer it. Luckily we were only staying 2 nights. Lovely though the place might be, I would've gone insane without internet for too long, and I wasn't about to give in and pay for their super overpriced wi-fi that should've been part of the package.\",\n",

Love this place!!!!!!\\n\\nI LOVE the 800 Degrees in LA, so I was super excited to find this restaurant on the strip!\\n\\nAll the pizza options are awesome....I especially loved the verde one, cause I'm a sucker for green sauce. \\n\\nThe toppings are yummy and fresh.....love the capers and kalamata olives. If you like spicy pizza, DEFINITELY get the chili sauce topping! It's to die for!  I even bought a bottle of the chili sauce on my 3rd visit here. \\n\\nEXTRA plus......it's walking distance from Aria.....so you can get great drinks and then head to 800 Degrees for a satisfying dinner :)\",\n",

Should have walked out when I found out natalie or jen was not there but decided to stay steak was dry (cooked medium) server never came back to check on us just because we are regulars doesn't mean we do not deserve the same service as any other customer.  We flagged manager down to let him know about steak and all he had to say was did you order dessert. .no!!! Would you like dessert uh no would have liked my steak redone but never offered I ended up just leaving. But to make things worse I asked for their District managers number and they didn't want to give it to me. I had it at home I called him and I've yet to get a response back on the issue, I wrote an email to the email that they gave me still nothing back from anyone I also went o  website to submit a comment for someone to contact me and a week later nothing. Everyone just be ware of service and management at this location if you so go in ask for natalie she will make sure your shit is right. So funny I am an assistant manager of a restaurant and it's crazy on how they run their business.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Took my boyfriend and my sister who are big Gwen Stefani fans for a meet and greet yesterday.  Total spent was $3000.00 dollars for the 3 of us to have a good time. Well at least I thought it would be a good time. When arriving at the desk we were given 3 tickets well at least I thought. When it came time for the meet and greet we were stopped at security because we were told are tickets would not scan. When we went back to the desk no one seemed to know what was going on with are tickets as all the works scrambled around from computer to computer to try to solve what wad going on. It was at that time another employee came up and told us that if we didn't come now we would miss the meet and greet. The front desk told us to go to the meet and greet and they would resolve what was going on when we get back. As we ran frantically down the long hall for the meet greet I couldn't help but think about it the whole time as my partner and sister kept asking if everything was okay. After the meet and greet we returned to the desk when they told us we only had tickets for meet and greet and not the actual show. When I pointed out to the workers that our tickets said GA which stands for general admission and seat 27 they said that my ticket was a mistake and could not explain why it said that. They then basically embarrassed me again and said we do not have tickets for the show. It was at that time I handed the gentleman my credit card and paid an additional 700 something dollars to purchase seats for the show. Almost 4000 dollars later I wanted to cry from the embarrassment from the staff and unprofessionalism experienced. I did not want to disappoint my boyfriend or my sister. We also had to ask for our vip lanyards and posters or else we probably would of walked out without them. Sorry to give such a bad review but I felt like the zappos staff could of done better considering the situation was not my fault and considering the amount of money I spent to have a good time. \\n\\nDon Patterson\",\n",

It advertised 3 pools (Wet Republic at MGM, Liquid at Aria and Venus at Caesar's Palace) but it only gave access to 2 pools and one of them was where you met to get on the bus.  So literally the bus only took us to one pool and didn't even pick us back up.\\n\\nWe met at Liquid at the Aria.  We were there for an hour and then got on the party bus.  It stopped at the Vegas sign for a picture which wasn't advertised and none of us cared about.  My friends and I just stayed on the bus to drink while others went out for a picture.  Then it took us to a pool called Sapphire which was off of the strip and left us there.  We had to get our own way back and never saw the party bus again.  It was a total rip off for only a 10-15 minute party bus ride.  The bus had free drinks but it was premixed Cuervo/canned beer and the ride was so short we only had time to down one or two drinks before it was over.\\n\\nLiquid at the Aria charged extra for chairs and wouldn't let us even put our sandals or purses down on the ground.  We had to check them.  Sapphire was off the strip and pretty empty with not much going on.  Nothing felt VIP.  We ended up walking all the way back to the strip from Sapphire because we didn't want to spend more money on a cab.  \\n\\nDefinitely NOT as advertised and NOT recommended!\",\n",

Long story short...the street tacos served at the wine tasting were 100x better than the food served at Tatuado.\\nThe chips tasted like they were straight from the bag.  The salsa tasted like it was straight from the bottle.  The potato salad they served tasted exactly like the Reser's kind you get at the deli (in other words, gross).  When I asked for chips with my sandwich, they brought out Sun Chips.  Really?  Everything I ate here I could've bought on my own at my local grocery store.\\nMy friends didn't like their food at all (cheese enchilada and chicken sandwich).  My club sandwich was good.  The biggest positive was the strawberry margarita.  It was delicious.  \\nOverall, this place was very mediocre.  I wouldn't return.  There are SO many better options in Vegas.\",\n",

One of the reasons is that it's a little bit pricier than Seafood City or Ranch 99 in the middle of town. The other reason is that it is smaller than Seafood City or Ranch 99.\\n\\nOne of the things that I love about this place is that it's on the Southeast side of town closer to where I live. This place is great for people who live in Henderson because we finally have a fairly large Market to shop at 4 Asian and Filipino foods. This place is just a little bit pricier than Seafood City but if you live in Henderson and don't feel like driving to the middle of town then this is a great place to go. It's also a little bit smaller but they seem to carry all of the basics.\\n\\nThe restaurant that they have inside is also really good. Because of the amount of traffic that seems to go through there the food seems to always be fairly fresh. I tried the Sisig, beef steak and BBQ Chicken skewer. The food was great. Although the Sisig was made a bit differently than what I'm used to it was still very good and full of flavor. I would definitely go back to try other dishes.\\n\\nThe one thing I was really surprised with the huge selection of ice cream. So many different flavors of ice cream like mango, Ube, Green Tea and Coconut. Next time I go I'm getting the Halo Halo ice cream.\\n\\nTo summarize if you live anywhere near Silverado Ranch and Bermuda you definitely need to check this place out, even if it's just to eat Filipino food in the restaurant.\",\n",

Her response was that she could give me 10% off another eighth.

Although we felt that the two guides got a little mad at us for getting lost, we still had a blast!\\n\\nThe tour lasts about four hours from the time they pick you up to drop off. We highly recommend Scoot City and the Red Rock Canyon Tour. It was amazing!!!!!!!\\n\\nThey also provide water to all riders, which was so nice of them. \\n\\nRemember to tip! We tipped extra because we got lost.\",\n",

For some people this is a good thing, but for those looking forward to being able to gamble and whatnot till 4AM in the morning and then take an elevator to your room to rest, try elsewhere.  Besides that though, this place is great.\\n\\nMy only gripe with this hotel was one involving me reserving 2 Queen/Solitaire Suite with (2) Queen Beds, but when I got there they only had the (2) suites with (1) King Bed each.  I spoke with them and called in for the pull in beds and it also helped that the couch was also a pull out too, so that served our needs.  So, all in all, wasn't a deal breaker.  \\n\\nI did like the suites though for the most part, bathroom was huge, Kitchen came stocked with glasses, silverware, and small appliances, no pots or pans, but it didn't matter.  Although we didn't use it that much, it was nice to have it available to us if we did.\\n\\nThe place itself is located (2) blocks from the strip and is pretty easy to find from the 15 Freeway.  Get off on flamingo and keep driving down, and it will be on your right.  \\n\\nAll in all, not a bad hotel, just make sure you confirm A FEW times before you go there.\",\n",

They were  quite but extremely polite.  Yes there\\'s a bit of a language barrier. However, they were Wonderful! The rooms were dark so we didn\\'t really get to see.

It was so relaxing and I cannot emphasize enough what a great job they did. We both had trouble staying awake. The professionalism while paying was an awesome change up from everywhere in the city where tips are \"expected.\" We tipped well because they most certainly deserved it. \\n\\nOverall: HIGHLY recommend! Don\\'t miss out because of location. This is a place to drive to! We drove 30min & the drive as well as every dollar was very well spent.',\n",

We were definitely planning on seeing it, so it was perfect! There were other discounts in the package (to an Asian restaurant and a Mexican one at Palazzo) but we didn't use those. \\n\\nThe Venetian...OMG, I loved that place! The perfume scent that others complain about in their reviews, actually wasn't bad...I was worried about it, being highly allergic to strong smelling perfumes, but it was actually really nice...I even miss it now...I didn't sneeze at all from it. We arrived early, 2pm, and they checked is in no problem (3pm is checkin)...Our room was very-very nice, my hubby's jaw sort of dropped when he first saw the room (I booked the whole thing so I already saw the pictures). It was very spacious, from the bathroom to the bedroom/living room...3 TVs in the place! I subtracted a star though b/c our TV in the bathroom did not work :( I was bummed b/c being a woman I spend a LOTTA time in there :) \\n\\nThe pool area on the 4th floor was very nice (there's another pool with more shade and more privacy on the 10th floor too)...I didn't check out Tao Beach, because I didnt even realize that was in a different area until later. My hubby walked by it and said it was nothing major, so I believed him. There were sufficient chairs at the pool, and the waitresses came by occasionally to see if anyone needed drinks. They could've made more money personally if they came by more frequently. Drinks were good, and the restaurant (Riva by Wolfgang Puck) has really good lunch menu (Pizza was great, and their salads too). \\n\\nOverall, next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely stay at the Venetian.\",\n",

The day of the reservation the driver was a little late, but they called to let us know, which was much appreciated. He only was 10 minutes behind due to traffic on the strip, which is understandable. When we arrived we only had to wait 20-30 minutes. The girl at the counter was super helpful and helped us decide which guns we wanted to try. Surprisingly, the sten ended up being my favorite for the day. Brandon walked us through the entire process, he was a great instructor, and very patient with us newbs. This is a bit embarrassing, but I somehow scratched my delicate hand while handling a gun, I'm usually a big baby, but Brandon was such a gentleman and even gave me a bandaid.

The games were grouped together by type of game, I loved the organization. There were different pinball machines sprinkled throughout the rows, besides the two/three full rows of pinballs. And I appreciate the cards with all of the info on each of the games such as what year the machine was made, how many were made and which machine that particular one is, perhaps having them typed up would make them more noticeable? \\n\\nMy favorite pinball machines were The Flintstones, Twilight Zone, and Shaq(I made a basket!)\\n\\nThere's an area blocked off from the games with a drink/frozen food machine and a 25cent popcorn machine.

There isn't much to say about the decor of the place as it is stashed in a hallway over by the ballrooms and has some tables and a single TV.  I ended up ordering the 16 oz dark roast while my girlfriend had a 16 oz iced tea.  Almost $8, ouch, but it is Vegas.  The coffee was strong but not particularly good and the iced tea was just decent.  I feel like I probably could have had better coffee playing the slots.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I wouldn't be back here in the future.  The coffee just wasn't that great.\",\n",

There is a sidewalk all around the perimeter which is great to explore the park. If you are feeling adventurous and are wearing a good pair of tennis shoes- then venture up to the top of the peak for a 365' view of our beautiful city. \\nMy only gripe is that the lawn is usually damp and some places even have puddles. I have been there mid-day when the sprinklers come on and spray all over the sidewalk. \\nDogs are allowed as long as leashed. \\nAlso, there are only a few trees so be aware during hot weather-bring a hat and some water. \\nThis is a very popular park for families so it can get crowded early on holidays.\",\n",

Instead we were greeted with a mediocre time.  \\n\\nOur drinks were good, but expensive. $24.50 for a Bloody Mary...Vegas prices!?!  Whatever.  The bottomless mimosas were just as expected.  The best part was the to-go cups with a fresh mimosa. \\n\\nThe food.... well, I ordered the Huevos Benedictito, a Spanish version of eggs Benedict.  Great in concept, but not execution.  The English muffin was tough and burnt, the carnitas was hard (how do you get meat hard & dry...too much time under the warming lamp perhaps), but the eggs and sauce were tasty.  At least there was something redeeming about the plate.  And don't even think about getting the hash browns unless you want some undercooked and not seasoned potato strings.  (I think they were potatoes?) They were bland and blended into the plate. My hubby ordered the Beach Bum omelette which looked good and full of veggies. He said it was okay, but he had the same lifeless pile of cardboard shoestring things they called hash browns. \\n\\nLastly, the table had no condiments.  No salt & pepper, no sugar, NOTHING. It's the little things that make up the big picture.  I hope it was just an off day, but I don't think I will take a gamble with giving Tom's Urban another chance. Sorry...\",\n",

The French fries it came with had about 10 times the normal amount of salt. I ordered a fish called bream and I could only eat a few bites. It was soaked in butter and covered in capers (which the menu did not state) and once again it was too salty to choke down. The brocoli was over salted as well. I generally love sea salt....but this was crazy over done. I guess the chef must have been back there getting his frustrations out. The tomato salad was excellent and the service was good.

First, I felt like no one really managed my project properly once I gave the green light to move forward.  I gave clear instructions to both Gomez and Travis that were not communicated properly to their install team.  This could have been prevented if either Travis or Gomez showed up to the install site.  The install team did a fair job installing the tile, however work had to be re-done due to the miscommunication.  Attention to detail was subpar and needed to be addressed.  I paid extra to have the grout sealed and they did a very poor job.  They only put on one coat and it was of very poor quality.  I had to go back through afterwords and properly seal the grout myself.  I am not sure if I would use Affordable Flooring for my next project....',\n",

One minor nitpick I have is that even though I'm glad they leave the utensils behind, they tend to place the utensils on the table, which I personally like to avoid since I usually put them on napkins. It would be nice if they offered replacement utensils other than just the ones on the table, although I guess maybe it's like that so that too much water isn't wasted.\\n\\nThere were a large variety of food dishes to choose from.

Here are my reviews for the entrees we order every time we go there:\\n\\nSeabass hotpot: this is a hit or miss. Sometimes the seabass is awesomely delicious and sometimes I wonder if it is the same dish I ordered the last time. Overall, it's our favorite thing to order on the menu.\\n\\nShrimp fried rice: it's nearly impossible to mess up fried rice unless you tried really hard. In this case, you would dishona our famiry!!! The shrimp is big and not the small wimpy dried ones a lot of the other places give. Can't go wrong if you want a rice dish.\\n\\nRoasted duck: the skin is gooey, not crispy as I want it. There is very little meat on it. I was a bit disappointed in this one..\\n\\nChow fun (dry): this dish is like Asian spaghetti. I like the fresh sprouts that they use and the noodles are always delicious.\\n\\nTomato onion scallops: yuck! I love scallops and decided to order this for the first time. There was so much sweet and sour dressing on it, it was like drinking that thing. Ugh... I expected it to be fried scallops with fresh tomatoes and onions, but i guess I was wrong on this dish. Just thinking about this dish gives me horrible flashbacks and makes me want to gag. No beuno!!!!\\n\\nService: usually really quick, but a few times we waited forever or they forgot our order.. The price is fairly cheap for the amount of food you get. I noticed that you get so much more food if you take it to go than eating there. :)\",\n",

Thanks again for your professionalism and understanding Justin, I can't thank you enough and will be back for our next vehicle purchase!\",\n",

When the crew got here to move (forgot the names of all but Anthony sorry guys) they were prompt clean and precise.

       "  'text': 'Came here December 28. I understand it\\'s busy due to the holidays and all, but i was pretty disappointed. Waited about half an hour to be seated...8 of us, 4 young children... Saw a group of about ten people walk in, walk to the back and seat themselves after one member gave the owner a nice hug. Finally sat down... 30 seconds later, server wanted to take our orders... Told him we needed minute... Waited forever for him to come back, ordered. Poor prefer included three phos with no onion. After waiting another 20 minutes one of our party asked where the heck was our food??! A server asked, \"no onions, right?\" \"That\\'s right. Three with NO onions.\" 7 minutes later, half our phos come out.... the three non onions had to wait another 7 minutes...\\nAnd it had plenty of onions on top and inside when it finally did decide to make an appearance. Wow. So no tip, but i give a few stars because the pho itself was pretty good, the server was friendly and possibly sincere enough and the owner offered to give a small discount after our complaint. But, for sure NOT returning.... At least not during any holiday... I could be more forgiving because we had to wait a long time (left the restaurant two hours later), but on top of the loooooong wait, they messed up our order after double checking it???!!!! So can\\'t give a great review! Sorry Jenni!\\nPS. What is up with the women\\'s restroom??! One door had no lock, the other one you had to lift the door to lock!!

       "  'text': 'P.J. Clarke\\'s opened tonight in the Forum Shops at Caesar\\'s.  Our regular Friday Night gang met there last night for the last of their \"soft openings.\"  In the interest of full disclosure, our dinner was comped, and was mostly limited to the evening\\'s featured \"softie\" - burgers.  I say mostly, because when we got there, late, victims of the traffic that engulfed the Strip due to the influx of CES tourists, our friends were already gorging on a plate of raw oysters, and that wasn\\'t on the list we were given.   We, too, were coming from the Convention center, and it took us 45 minutes to get to Caesar\\'s, then another 10 to get the car valet\\'d, since that, too, was full.\\n\\nHubster and I don\\'t eat oysters, so our friends managed to convince them to bring us shrimp.  And gawd, those were the biggest damned shrimp I\\'ve ever seen.  They were terrific.\\n\\nThe real freebie consisted of wine or beer, burgers, fries, and salad.  We\\'re white wine drinkers, and there was no Riesling, just Chardonnay and Pino Grigio.  The Pino was super dry, so I had some Merlot.  The salad was one big disappointment, just a pile of ugly greens with a few thin slices of the tiniest baby radish I ever could imagine.  Your eight bucks won\\'t get you anything else, not even a crouton.\\n\\nThe burgers were great - fresh, meaty, not oversalted - but the buns were just ordinary.  I ordered mine with Vermont cheddar, sauteed onions, and mushrooms.  Toppings are $1.20 each, so that brought the burger close to $14, which I guess is par for the Strip, which is why we stick mostly local.  I also ordered a cup of coffee, and it was cold.\\n\\nWhat really drowned this place for us, though, was the water, pun intended.  The waiter asked whether we all wanted water.  I said \"no,\" but got it anyway.  It was served in small glasses slightly larger than juice glasses, with no logo.  There was no brand to approve, no cork to sniff, no swirling nor sniffing.  Yet when we got the pretend bill, we noticed that THEY CHARGED FOR THE WATER!!!  What the hell are they thinking???  Has Lake Mead become a designer label??  And that, dear reader, is my death knell for this restaurant.\\n\\nThe service was spotty.  The place wasn\\'t more than one-third full, yet our waiter had some trouble keeping up and getting things right.  Service picked up tremendously when Marty, who said he was a busser, joined the team.  A young and earnest full-time Type A, he went over and above to see that we were satisfied.  He was definitely worth the price of admission.\\n\\nP.J. Clarke\\'s is a venerable New York institution, in business since 1884, and that\\'s no typo.  They\\'re suddenly pushing to go national - they have a branch in Chicago, one that just opened in D.C., and now, Vegas.  I tried to check the website to see what the full menu is like, but the links on the Vegas page aren\\'t working, at least on Firefox and Chrome.  (I don\\'t go near IE).  IMHO, this is symbolic of the lengths they\\'ll need to travel to distinguish themselves from all the competition in this town.  And if they persist in charging for tap water, it\\'s going to be a long road to travel.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I was moving back to Las Vegas for work and wanted to buy a house. I did a lot of research in finding a mortgage broker and ended up going with Casey. What first impressed me is that she was very quick to respond to my email and voicemail. She did not try to hard pressure sell me on anything but just genuinely wanted to help.  She was dependable and honest when explaining my expectations.  As a first time home buyer I felt like it was a huge undertaking but Caseys help during the entire loan process made it feel easy.  She showed her true knowledge as a lending professional from recommending a realtor to the title company we wound up using.  She worked diligently to keep me up to date on the process throughout the entire loan from start to finish. I can tell she had her systems in place and a great team to work with. I will be recommending her to all my Friends and Family!',\n",

I like how this casino has a more relaxed feel yet still shares the excitement of the Vegas scene.

My fkight was supposed to take off at 0700 and it is now 1146. First they move gates, then the plane they move us too has a flat tire, which they find on a preflight inspection 20min before boarding? I'm in the airforce, we complete these checks at least 2hrs prior to flight. Then the Nav CDU craps out then they get an engine indication light. They remove and board us 3 times then ground the plane. They still dont know when or if we will get a flight out. They give us meal vouchers to use in airport, of after you get your voucher it says in the fine print that by accpeting the voucher you cant lay anymore claim to the airline. Fooled you. This airline is a joke, their planes are garbage and in top of everything else I missed my grandmother's funeral. Thanks\",\n",

All car agencies are in the one center. The lines were moving slowly but there is a kiosk available - at least with Enterprise - to the right of the queue. The gas option where you prepay for a full tank and then can return it empty was a good deal at $3.55; I saw gas later on in the city for $3.75. Once you complete at the kiosk/counter you take a short escalator ride downstairs to the garage. You walk to your selected companies location and there an employee (at least with Enterprise) walks you to car and you sign the contract. The process was a bit odd it seemed because the kiosk asked me nothing about insurance - the lady downstairs asked about that after I had already agreed on the kiosk to the payment amount. \\n\\nReturn of the car was easy. The city has signs up as you get near so you know where to go. I pulled my car into one of Enterprise's three return lanes and was checked in and given a receipt in fewer than 5 minutes. You can ride the free shuttle back 7 minutes to the airport. I don't rent a car often but from when I have I can say this is one of the better set ups.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"For the price, you can't beat this Korean buffet place.  it is like $13 for lunch and $17 for dinner.  Most of the other Korean places are a bit too expensive ~ Suri is $27 (more variety) and the Mother Korean is $25.  My wife loves Korean so we try to do it once a month.  If we went more often (esp to a buffet), I probably ballon into the Michelin man.\\n\\nAs for the restaurant, outside, it doesn't look too appealing.  In fact, it looks like a run down shack.  The inside is like a diner setup.  Kinda long and curves around the end.  However, it was kinda cozy.\\n\\nAs for the service, the 4x's that we have been there, we thought the service was pretty good (granted, all 4x's, we were with a large party).  They filled your drinks and got you a scissor, forks, and napkins pretty often.  Only issue that I had was that they only allow you one scissor per table.  Kinda sucks when you have to cut alot of Gabbi and Korean Ribs.  Otherwise, service was good.  By the way, one of the things that I do like is that they regularly change your grille when it needs changing.  \\n\\nAs for the food, dessert looks awful.  Don't go there.  There non-meat dishes are nothing to talk about.  However, you are at a Korean buffet; so, eating meat and seafood is the key.  Their meat selection and seafood are pretty good.  Actually, I think it is comparable to other Korean restaurants in town.  Each time, I usually focus on eating the shrimp and Korean BBQ ribs.  Oooh la la.  Granted, you don't get the selection of the other restaurants, but you do get your money's worth.  Also, by the time that you are done eating, you do feel like a stuff pig.  Oink!  I guess this is one of the reasons why we come here often.\\n\\nCheers,\",\n",

       "  'text': \"We decided to stop in here after after a failed attempt at lunching at Mon Ami Gabi. We approached the hostess stand and it seemed as though it was painful for the three scantly clad hostesses to make any type of eye contact with us. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait for an inside table (it was a late Saturday afternoon). They take your phone number and send you a text when your table is ready. Much to my surprise, we received a text about 15 minutes later and were taken to a table that had been open the entire time we were sitting in the lobby area. \\n\\nOh well, next...it took a bit for the server to come to our table, a little longer to take the order, even longer to get our food...we spent a lot of time waiting. In our sever's defense - you could see that she had a ton of tables and was working really hard. I was totally disappointed to learn that they no longer had the Monte Cristo sandwich and got a club (very average) and chicken tenders (kind of weird/artificial tasting). The chicken tenders come with a chipotle dipping sauce that was kind of tasty. We finished our meal, paid without being offered a desert menu ($12-$15) and then ventured into the attached gift shop/candy store and decided against buying our daughter an $89 Hello Kitty backpack (it just seemed a bit overpriced). Plus the music was so loud, I am not sure that my tympanic membrane could handle another minute of it. In the end, I think we saved more than we spent, so it wasn't a total loss.\",\n",

She 's always buzy, so I highly suggest to call and book the appointment ahead of time. Then all you need to do is to tell her what you want to be done and trust her professional skill with confidence cause she won't disappointed you. Even if you bring a wig to her, she can cut exactly looks like that on you, she is just that good. Everyone sees me love my hair style, even the one on the street walking by me that I don't know them, just stop by and say that they love it, it's weird but it's true. Just give Gina a try if you can't find a better hair dresser, her shop is at the left of the greenland mall by Rainbow & Spring Mountain. Then you will find that a new you is only a hairCut away...To my opinion, Gina is just God-send! And it's true, she is also a very devoted Christian as you can hear the Christian radio channel that she always play in her shop. And so you know she won't open on Sunday.\",\n",

The taste wasn't too bad, good amount of spice, just lack luster overall.  \\n\\nThe bulgogi in my opinion is always the sweetest dish.  it's never really the best cut of meat, sometimes fatty, but then once in a while, you get lucky.  I would say, mediocre for this dish.  \\n\\nThe seafood pancake was not cooked to crisp at all.  The batter was too heavy, making it a mushy pancake versus a more nicely cooked, no soggy batter in your mouth feeling.  The seafood was okay, but I wouldn't order this dish again.  \\n\\nThe worst of it all, was the banchan sides.  The kimchi, seaweed, cucumbers were all super dry.

On the bright side I can scoot this  to the side and make a whole other sandwich with the bread that is left over. Dark side I don\\'t order food to go home and make food. Was my two bites packed full of flavor that would have me running back for another $9 bite size snack. Nooo not at all. The meat had no flavor, the onions and peppers had no flavor didn\\'t even know it could have no flavor. They did do one good thing they did wash their hands and change their gloves and use clean utensils when I said my next order had to be gluten free and she said her food was okay.',\n",

He hoped that I would try to company again, and actually I really will now. In fact, based upon this follow-up, I have recommended this company to a friend.

       "  'text': 'My friend and I went to SF last Sunday night cause Mon Amis Gabis had a huge wait. We quickly got a table outside overlooking the Bellaggio fountains. The menu is very extensive so it was a tough choice. We had the fried Macaroni appetizer, which was nice, the sauce was excellent, then he had a great salmon and I had french onion. The only minus of the experience was the entrees came out way too soon. When i was a waitress we\\'d \"fire\" the second course when patrons were on their last bite of appetizers. My friend\\'s salmon was fine when the kitchen had to hold the food awhile, but my soup wasn\\'t nice and piping hot. The waitress, Heather, was great and so was the busser (didn\\'t get his name) The cocktails look very fun and creative, but I ultimately skipped the liquid desert. Service is great, but they need to be careful about entrees arriving too soon. Our table top was teeny, so we didn\\'t have room for the entrees til our app plates were cleared. So, bottom line is extensive menu, great views, great backup option to Mon Amis, high quality service, but maybe a wrinkle or two in the \"back of house\" kitchen area. Again, Heather was great and I recc her, she told me her nights off are Wed and Thur.',\n",

When you walk in they have a really nice seating area with booths and one side with half booths half tables. They have Kpop music videos playing and pretty decor in here. The food on the menu is sooooo good. They have a variety of everything. We ordered the bulgogi pizza an order of baked mussels and mozzarella sticks. The bulgogi pizza is essentially a supreme with marinated beef. Very tasty! The mozzarella sticks were awesome can't go wrong with fried cheese. The baked mussels were a 10! I will go back and try more options for sure! The service was very friendly and not rushed at all. She even let me take my drink afterwards to Karaoke Q because we had a room! The drinks were a 10! I ordered the frozen strawberry daiquiri with apple reds and my boy ordered the mango with mikes hard lemonade! So good! I will definitely have to come back and try more!\",\n",

Music was of cool mix, hip hop and edm and we danced for hours. No big time DJ that night but that might not be a bad thing, so table service aren't crazily expensive and not overly packed. Most of our girls prefer clear stuff so they ordered GG and a few of us stopped by the bar for the brown stuff, which is only a few tables away to cure our thirst for shots. The bathroom trips aren't too far either. I can't recall if i've been here years ago for the after-hour party but the club still looks decent. It's A-Ok for us!\\nOnly thing that sucked was having a creeper standing by our table for hours. Making nasty remarks and stick his tongue out to each of us...herrrrro, GROSS.

       "  'text': 'I love unique flavor combinations that are not overpowering.  Most of the dishes have a unique ingredient that gives it a new twist, without taking over the traditional base.  My favorite dish by far here is the Baja Ceviche.  It inspires me to make my own ceviche at home every time i have it.   A delicate blend of fish, shrimp, red onions, tomato, avocado and a fresh cilantro sauce drizzled over.   \\n\\nMy other favorites from prior visits are the empanadas and the sweet green mini tamales.  Last night I had the chicken poblano enchiladas.  Let me say I have been craving green enchiladas for about 6 months.  I loved the chicken filling and loved the addition of thinly sliced portobello mushrooms, corn, nopal and poblano on top,  BUT there was WAY too much Green sauce, drowning some of the awesome flavors.  Would have been much better with a drizzling of the green sauce and the addition of some melted white cheese.  After all it can\\'t be great enchiladas without lots of cheese.   \\n\\nMy husband had the carnitas,  which were delicious.  Again unique ingredients added a twist,  bacon, citrus and a bed of polenta underneath.  His flour tortilla was the yummy authentic type.  \\n\\nMy other favorite last night was the CABO RITA, mmmmmm,  pear puree in a  margarita made with fresh lime juice and agave,  versus sweet and sour and triple sec.   One of the best margaritas I\\'ve ever had.  \\n\\nSadly the service SUCKED.  Our waitress never once came to check on us.  We had to wave her,  or the busboy down every time we needed something.  It even took 20 minutes just to get and process the check and we had to ask 3 times to move it along.   Also, sadly, when we made the reservation, they promised a pool view booth which was not available when we got there.  there was a front pool view table, which we said we would take, but it was \"reserved\"  to make a big table for a future reservation.   When we left, it was occupied by another couple, not  a big table.   Being lied to doesn\\'t make the guest feel appreciated. \\n\\nHad it not been for the service and the over abundance of green sauce, and the slight overprices,  I would rate 5 stars. The awesomeness of the Ceviche and the Margarita, raise it from 3 stars to 4.  \\n\\nIf you like unique tastes,  I would still recommend.   \\n\\nThe night was capped beautifully by a fun shopping excursion at my stores, Misura, Paradiso and Ruby Blue near the valet entrance!',\n",

We asked about the market price on one of the special crab, the answer was, \"I don\\'t know what the price is... plus we don\\'t have it anymore anyway\".  10 minutes later.. saw another table that came after us ordered a bunch of those crab.  Asked for a Sapporo, never came, finally came, but a different kind of beer, and said they don\\'t have Sapporo or most of the beer on the menu.  One main dish (cajun clam) came out when we were about to finish the whole meal.  \\n\\nFood: Shrimp are big...but tough texture and seemed very overcooked. Plus their items (shrimp, clams) didn\\'t come in a bag like HnJ, so flavors aren\\'t mixed and steamed together.  Corn and potatoes are on a separate plate with 0 flavor.  And the corn was cold in the middle like some other reviewers were saying.  \\n\\nOverall, we came in with an open mind and walked away disappointed.  We want this place to be good and do well, but they didn\\'t deliver.  Staff was friendly, but not very good at servicing people.  \\n\\nThe only good thing about this place is it\\'s on restaurant.com, so we were able to save $50 off by using the certificate.

       "  'text': \"The selection of spirits was not inspired. I was intrigued by the idea that I could sample some craft beer and get a growler, especially since it was 107¬∞.  This turned out not to work so good.  The proprietor asked if I was looking for something, and I said no, I was browsing.  Which I did.  Since I didn't see anything else interesting, I went over and read all the info on the beers on tap.  Then I read them again.  Since the guy was sitting and laughing with a couple ten feet from me, I figured he'd ask if I wanted something.  Nope.  Guess they sell enough $35 growlers that they don't have to worry about selling another one to an out-of-towner.  Maybe the store is kind of a hobby operation, though it seems like an expensive one.\\n\\nI should have just butted in to his conversation, but I was feeling kind of Midwestern.  I noticed the other day that Total Wines has growlers too, but they have people that ask what you want, and they have quarts as well as half gallons, which is more attractive in some cases.  I'd have given these guys three stars on their selection and they could've earned another on the service.  Instead, they lost one.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I'm not a sushi purist. While I'd love to eat nothing but delicate cuts of sashimi and simple, well-crafted nigiri, my wallet dictates that I feast on rolls if I want a satisfying meal without spending a fortune. And I have no problem eating crazy, sauce-covered rolls that would horrify most Japanese and drive them to seppuku. \\n\\nMy tastes are Americanized, afterall, so rolls are cool with me. Their specialty rolls are half price all day, every day. But, if you use a restaurant.com gift card like I did on my first visit you have to pay full-price for the rolls.\\n\\nThe rolls we've tried have all tasted good -- the Bonzai, Red Dragon, Spicy tuna crunch, Hawaiian, and Yellowtail cover rolls. But, are sometimes sloppily assembled. Having ordered some of the rolls twice, we noticed that they don't always come out the same. QA issues aside, I can't really complain because the food is relatively inexpensive.\\n\\nThe yellowtail with jalape√±o ($13) was also solid. We ordered tuna sashimi ($12) but what they brought out was seared tuna with a bunch of crispy stuff on top. We tried telling the waitress it was wrong but she insisted that that was how they do it there. Right... I guess that's what they tell all the non-Asian looking folk. \\n\\nThat brings me to my biggest gripe about this place -- the service. They're friendly, but slow. If you want a quick meal this is the last place you should go. Expect a long wait to have your order taken and even more time to go by before you get your food. If you want refills, think again. Even if the place is empty, which it was on both of our visits, you'll spend a good hour and a half or more eating there.\\n\\nAt least the place is comfy. The interior is quite spacious and they have a few large TVs scattered around in addition to a projection screen and a stage where there is occasionally live music. Large booths are scattered around the room, making your wait time somewhat more enjoyable.\\n\\nDespite its flaws, it's a good place to get some rolls at a decent price if you're not in a hurry.\\n\\n3.5 Stars\",\n",

I came into the show not being a Beatles fan but after the show I can't stop listening to their songs on my ipod! If you are a Beatles fan I would definitely check out this show. Lots of cool acts and entertainment.\\n\\nI believe this is one of the more expensive Cirque du Soliel shows due to it's popularity but I was able to get 2 balcony seats for about $110 each. I have also sat in the limited view seats that are around $95 that were also not bad, but not as exciting as the other seats since you cannot see the whole stage.\",\n",

In the beginning, we had chosen the cheapest option, but we were upgraded because we had a special guest musician perform for us.  The upgrades were great!  The flower bouquet and boutonniere was so pretty!!!  The cake pops were delicious and the set up looked great!  We had also wanted an Elvis minister, so they put us in touch with one and he was fantastic!!  I would definitely recommend getting married at Denny's if you are thinking about getting married in Vegas!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Came here for a brunch/lunch on our last day in Vegas. With six girls and all varying tastes and preferences, this was a great choice! Mexican food is always a hit, and I particularly enjoy it, so I was really pleased when the birthday girl suggested it! She'd been here on a previous trip to Vegas and recommended it.\\n\\nWe came here at 11:00 because that was when they started serving lunch. They also offer an all-inclusive brunch of small plates, but we were not up for another buffet before the long flight home. We did order a couple of appetizers (guacamole and queso). The guac was really good, and the chips were a huge standout. Freshly fried, they were super fresh and difficult to stop eating. They came with three types of salsa, all of which were good. (None were particularly spicy, but they were all flavorful). The queso was a bit on the runny side for my taste, which also made it difficult to share.\\n\\nI ordered nachos for my lunch- if you know me, you'd expect this. The nachos suffered from structural issues in their construction. The beans were spread all over the bottom of the plate, with chips on top of them. Toppings were layered on top and baked, so the chips never stood a chance. They were super soggy by the time they made it to the table. The flavor was good, but I mostly picked the chips from the top and left the sodden bottom layer. I added steak to the nachos, and this was a very good choice- the meat was hot, cooked medium, and made a great addition to the dish.\\n\\nOther girls got tacos, and that's definitely what I would order the next time. Enjoy the crispy chips as an appetizer, but I don't recommend the nachos unless you make a special request to re-structure. Our waitress was nice but pretty absent, and I don't think that type of special request would have been well-received, although I think they would have done it.\\n\\nWe sat on the patio, and it was really nice out there! It's covered and there are fans, so even when it's warm outside, this is a good option to get some fresh air.\",\n",

I believe the store is less than 10 years old from what I read online but the store looked quite rundown and dirty. No one asked me if I needed help. I had a long line at the checklanes. I would have just left but I really wanted to but the holiday Lego Bullseye 2010 gift cards. I usually like to walk around Target and was curious to see what the difference between a regular Target is and a Target Greatland but I spent less than 20 minutes here because of my dislike. I saw a small grocery section with cold and frozen food so I'm guessing that's the difference. Hopefully when I visit again, this Target will have stepped it up. ^_^*~\",\n",

She was very informative, friendly, and patient with my quirks to keep myself calm during the process.  \\n\\nBoth piercings definitely hurt (which I expected) but it was worse than I initially thought lol of course.. after all a needle is pushed through your nostril.  She cleaned me up briefly, gave me verbal instructions on cleaning it (I wish they gave you something written b/c my memory sucks!), and I was on with my afternoon.\\n\\nAbout 4-5 days had passed and one of my piercings had begun to sink into my skin (nothing that was done on her end, btw--my body just reacts weird to piercings).  I let her know and she came in the next day on her day off to change them out for me!  Since then, they have been A-OK which shows that she knew exactly how to fix the problem.

       "  'text': 'I am now what I would consider a expert Timeshare traveler.  I purchased my timeshare in 2005 in Sedona and have stayed in about seven of them since then. Funny thing is that we have never stayed in our own, we don\\'t usually visit he same place twice.  From Montana to South Florida, we have certainly have gotten great use out of our timeshare purchase.  \\n\\nWith that being said, I found this resort to be one of the best we have ever stayed at.  We reserved a two bedroom for 5 of us, two couples and a young adult child.  We were assigned to the Rosemary tower which was one of the newly renovated towers.  We had both rooms for the lockout suite, which included two full 1 bedrooms to give a total of two King bedrooms, 2 kitchens and 2 living rooms.  The rooms are connected by an outer area, and we were able to keep the doors open to feel like we have a huge open apartment.  The space we had was incredible.\\n\\nThe resort is situated right next door to the Southpoint casino.  When you check in at the resort they give you coupon books for the casino.  When you go to the resort, go sign up for the rewards program before you purchase or do anything.  It only takes 5 minutes and with the 1st coupon in the book, you get $20 free slot play.  We had fun with the 4 of us playing our $20 each.  No one won but we had fun.  The rewards card gets you money off the buffets and the coupons give free bottles of wine you can take back to your room. \\n\\nI was quite surprised at how the good the food was at the buffets.  The prime rib was really good.  We went on Surf Turf and grapes night.  Each adult buffet came with 2 free glasses of wine and then we took a bottle back to our room with the coupon.  \\n\\nThe next morning we went back for the buffet $6.95 a person with your rewards card.  This included your coffee and juices.  Although not generally a fan of breakfast buffets, this one was decent.  The negative, this one is packed.  It \"closes\" at 10 am and you must clear out by 10:30.  We got there about 9;45 and it was a madhouse.  Get there early!  And opt for the fresh omelet station, well worth the wait then the buffet scrambled eggs.\\n\\nOne of the best things about the resorts was the pool.  It was the last week of July for our stay and it was hot.  Somehow, they were able to keep the pools cool and refreshing.  They felt amazing.\\n\\nI can\\'t say enough about this resort, friendly, spacious and very well maintained.  I know a lot of people  complain about being pressured to buy, but when we checked in, I just said no to the free breakfast and whatever else they wanted to offer us.  Been there done that, just don\\'t go, you don\\'t have to do it.',\n",

But considering it was in walking distance and I was in Vegas this is the place to try new places. Me and my friend walked to here and from the get go it's a nice little cafe. Plenty of seating, and everyone is pretty friendly. There menu is nice, I mean I wish they were in Cali where the beaches are. It makes me kind of sad cause honestly it beats out the one breakfast/lunch place we have here. But at least it gives me somewhere to look forward too when I come back. Me and my friend ended up coming six days out of the seven days we were here. I ended up mainly getting the cafe breakfast with a bagel and bacon. And their iced coffee. I'll admit the first few times it was kind of watered down, but it did its job and it's free refills. Their sun kissed iced tea is yummy and sweet too. I did have their bbq bacon cheeseburger and fries and they were good too. I mean I wish I had tried more variety but I'm kind of a plain jane kind of guy. The cafe breakfast ended up being my go to, and I'm not a huge breakfast person. They also have specials here and there. They had a captain crunch French toast that was to die for . The prices were fair, I usually ended up paying about 10 for my food and drink. On top of it if you're the type to frequent this place. Ask for a meal card you get a free meal after about I believe 10 or 12 meals. But hey, free food is always good.\",\n",

It was not overly sweet, as you might imagine. It had a perfect blend of tastes. I crave it all the time. The specialty cocktails were very expensive for drinks. My friends had a mango mohito, and said that they were awesome. The service was good. The atmosphere is great. It was very busy at all, which I couldn't understand, but it was overall a great experience. Highly recommended for a reasonably priced, nice meal (reasonably prices for Vegas, that is).\",\n",

It's not a fancy casino by any means, but it's clean and not overly smoky.  The bowling alley is also very clean.  The shoe rentals are a little beat up, but this facility has kept up well.  There are numerous lanes and people seem to be pretty aware of bowling etiquette.  Depending on the time of day, games and shoes go for $3.50/ea.  The lanes are all automated (bumper capable) and there are televisions interspersed if you get bored staring at your own screen.  \\n\\nThe workers there aren't overly friendly nor happy to be working, but they are efficient and willing to answer questions.  We didn't play any bingo or watch a movie, but the slots were fun and not completely begrudging in letting the patron win.  Some food options available here were a buffet, seafood bar, steak n shake, Dreyer's ice cream.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a quick escape from the hustle of the strip and kick back, South Point might be the answer for you.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I used to love this swim school, and both my kids attended for several years. The sad truth is that, over the past 6 months to a year, Water Wings has gone downhill dramatically and drastically. My kids no longer swim at Water Wings for several reasons, but my chief concern was many new and inexperienced swim teachers that simply put, do not know how to effectively teach children to swim. Unfortunately, most of the seasoned instructors from years past either no longer work with the company or have moved to California to work at the newest location. I paid for private lessons (not cheap) and in many classes the primary instructor was busy \"training\" a new instructor or chatting with a colleague. I understand training is necessary but it shouldn\\'t take away or undermine the meat of the lesson, especially considering the cost and limited time allotment.\\n\\nAs a parent one of my main concerns - besides the instructors\\' inexperience - is the lack of accountability for children\\'s safety. Employees are neither background checked nor drug tested, which in my opinion, is unacceptable when staff is in direct contact with children. (Not only, but you are quite literally putting your children\\'s lives in their hands when you hand them over in a pool.) Additionally, the pool and facility is often dirty and unsanitary. This became more apparent to me after switching my kids to swim at another facility. There have been many incidents over the years (dirty play area, grimy shower area, floating grossness in the pool) but the one that stands out to me was when an individual had vomited in the locker room. I notified the staff and instead of properly cleaning it up, they had sprayed it repeatedly with a noxious cleaner (but did not wipe or clean the area). Eww. \\n\\nThe front desk staff is hit or miss. Some of them are super sweet and accommodating and some are rude and standoffish. As though they are better than you. Interesting. I\\'ve overheard them gossiping about their colleagues and other friends and even clients! Talking sh*t about your clients - and their kids - is not the best idea and is certainly unprofessional. I could go into more details but I think you get the point. \\n\\nMoral of the story is - I would have recommended years ago hands down. Today I would caution to stay away.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Some buffets you can go wrong with and some are great. This one was towards the great side with an average of 85% which is extremely high for a buffet. \\nYou never know what you are getting with a buffet such as how long the good has been out for or who has sneezed on what or who has touched what and put it back, etc. \\nI love how they have divided up the sections into different cultures of food such as seafood, Mexican and Japanese. I stayed away from the Japanese section with the sushi because you never know with the raw fish how long it has been out there and if it has been stored properly. I was also disappointed with the Chinese food section. All they really had was dim-sum, dumplings and fried rice. Where was the sweet and sour pork or the ginger beef especially? \\nThe dessert section was definitely the best with all the ice cream you could imagine. However I was surprised that the salad bar was hidden and that the dessert section was at the front rather than at the end as dessert usually happens at the end of the meal but they had the dessert section first.',\n",
